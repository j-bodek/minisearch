   "Herm": "Herm is the smallest of the Channel Islands that is open to the public. Herm is only 1\u00bd miles long. Cars are banned from the small island just like its Channel Island neighbour, Sark. Unlike Sark, bicycles are banned too. The sandy white beaches make Herm a walker's paradise.",
   "Universe": "In astronomy, the universe is \"everything out there\". It contains the sun, all the planets including Earth, all of our galaxy, plus many other galaxies, and all of outer space. It is so huge that scientists measure its size in billions of light years - the distance light travels in a whole year. To travel in a spaceship, using today's knowledge, to even the nearest star would take centuries. In between the stars and galaxies, it is mostly empty and very cold. \"Cosmology\" is the science studying its origin, how it changes, and its future. Through history, different theories about it have been made, but the theory accepted by most scientists today is called the \"Big Bang\". It tells us the universe was once very dense, and then began expanding (\"bang\") a long time ago. Across history, many people have come up with ideas explaining how the universe came to be. Many origin myths, folktales that are passed from generation to generation that try to tell how the universe formed, have been created. Some have tried to explain it using gods, these stories are known as \"religious creation myths\". No one really knows the answer, and this has been the subject of many theories.",
   "Internet": "The Internet is a worldwide network of interconnected computer networks that transmit data by packet switching using the standard Internet Protocol (IP). It is a \"network of networks\" that consists of millions of smaller domestic, academic, business, and government networks, which together carry various information and services, such as electronic mail, online chat, file transfer, and the interlinked Web pages and other documents of the World Wide Web. History. The Internet was created in the United States in 1969 by the \"United States Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\" (known as \"ARPA\"). The World Wide Web was created at CERN in Switzerland in the 1990s by a British (UK) man named Tim Berners-Lee. Today, people can pay a fee to access the Internet from Internet Service Providers. Some services on the Internet cost nothing to use. Sometimes the people who run these free services use advertising to make money from them. The alternative name, \"Net\" came from \"inter(net)\". Services on the Internet. The Internet is used for many things, such as electronic mail (e-mail), online chat, and the World Wide Web. The most used service on the Internet is the World Wide Web (which is also called the \"Web\"). The Web contains websites, blogs, and also wikis - including Wikipedia. Webpages on the Web can be seen and read by anyone (unless the page needs a password, or it is blocked). The second major use of the Internet is to send and receive e-mail. E-mail is private and goes from one user to another. Instant messaging (such as AIM or ICQ) is similar to email, but allows two or more people to chat to each other much quicker. Some governments consider the Internet to be a bad thing, and block some or part of it. For example, the Chinese government think that Wikipedia is bad, so often no one in China can read it or add to it. Some parents block parts of the Internet they think are bad for children to see. Dangers on the Internet. The Internet can also be a dangerous place. Information people put on the Internet is not",
   "History of Australia": "People have lived in Australia for more than 50,000 years. The first people in Australia were the Aboriginal people. We think they came by boat from the islands of what is now Indonesia. They lived in all parts of Australia. Their lives were simple, they had very few needs. They lived by hunting, fishing and gathering food. They lived in bands, and they spoke many different languages. In 1606 people from the Netherlands, France, and Britain found the land currently known as Australia. First they found the north and west coast. This was dry and apparently uninhabitable land, and they found no economic reasons to stay. But in 1770 a British sailor, Captain James Cook, encountered the east coast of Australia. He called it New South Wales, and claimed it for Britain. He thought it would be a good place to settle. In 1788 the British sent a fleet of ships to settle Australia. Britain needed a place to send its convicts (people who had been sent to jail for theft and other crimes). Its jails were full. This First Fleet settled at a place they called Sydney. For the first few years they did not have much food, and life was very hard. But soon they began to farm, and more people came. Sydney grew, and new towns were started. Soon people from Sydney found other parts of Australia. George Bass and Matthew Flinders sailed south to Tasmania. Hamilton Hume and William Hovell went south by land. They found the Murray River, and good land in Victoria. Thomas Mitchell went inland, and found more rivers. Others went north and found Queensland. Soon more towns and cities were started. Then, gold was found in 1851. Many more people wanted to come to Australia. The country grew very fast, and some people became very rich. As the towns and farms spread across Australia, the Aboriginal people were pushed off their land. Some were killed, and many died from illness and hunger. Soon few were left, and they were made to live on small reserves. In 1840 Britain stopped sending convicts to Australia. The people in Australia wanted to run their own country, and not be told what to do from London. So in 1851 New South Wales, Victoria and the other colonies established their own Parliaments, where they could make their own laws. The goldrushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to massive immigration and population growth across south east Australia and the generation of great wealth and industry. The Commonwealth of Australia. Until 1901, Australia was not a nation, it was six separate colonies governed by Britain. This worked well when everybody was British and there were only a few people. But now there was thousands of people and many of them had never been to Britain, an eight month journey away by sea. If people in one colony wanted to buy or sell things to people in another colony, they had to ask permission. They decided to join together to form one new country, the Commonwealth of Australia. This was called Federation, and happened in 1901. But Australia was still part of the British Empire, and still felt very close to Britain and the British King. Australia soon had its own money, and its own Army and Navy. Because Australia was a very big country, and was so close to Asia, the Australians feared that people from Asia might take the country over. So they passed a law that only people from Britain or other European countries could come to Australia. This was called the White Australia Policy. It lasted for more than 60 years. In Australia at this time, the trade unions were very strong, and they started a political party, the Labor Party. Australia passed many laws to help the workers. Australia was also one of the first places in the world where women could vote. In 1914, the First World War started in Europe. Australia joined in on the side of Britain and France, against Germany. Australian soldiers were sent to Gallipoli, in Turkey. They fought bravely, but were beaten by the Turks. Today Australia remembers this battle every year on ANZAC Day. They also fought in France and Belgium. More than 60,000 Australians were killed in the war. In 1939 the Second World War broke out. Again Australia joined in to help Britain. But in 1941 Japan attacked Australia, and Australians had to fight close to home for the first time. Many people feared that Japan would invade Australia. But with help from the United States, the Japanese were stopped. After the war, Australia became a close friend of the United States. When the war ended, Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work. So the government said it would take in people in Europe who had lost their homes in the war. Over the next 25 years, millions of people came to Australia. They came from Italy, Greece, Yugoslavia, Poland and other countries in Europe. Later they also came from countries like Turkey and Lebanon. In the 1960s the White Australia Policy was ended. Many people came to Australia from China, Vietnam, Malaysia and other countries in Asia. Some Australians began to think of their country as being a part of Asia for the first time. But other Australians did not like this and said that Australia should keep its European character. In the 1960s and 1970s Australia became one of the richest countries in the world, because it could mine a lot of iron and other things from the ground that other countries wanted to buy. Companies from United States and Europe came to Australia to increase their profits, and many Australians got jobs with them. Australia also supported the United States in wars in Korea, Vietnam and Iraq. Some Australians protested against these wars. Australia's democracy meant that both sides could say what they thought. Today Australia is a rich, peaceful and democratic country. But it still has many problems. Some people are still poor, mainly those who do not have jobs, or whose farms do not make enough money. The Aboriginal people want some of their lands back, and Australians do not agree on what to do about this. Australia also doesn't know what to do with refugees - people who come to Australia by boat saying they have nowhere else to go. Some Australians want to let them stay and live in Australia, but some other Australians do not want to let them in.",

   "Bankrupt": "Anything that does not have enough money to pay all of its debt is insolvent. If it applies for protection by law it may then be bankrupt. In many countries a company or business can \"file for bankruptcy protection\" so that creditors cannot destroy all of the physical capital and goodwill by breaking it apart and moving it away. All this provides is more time to work out a new deal between the owners and the people the business owes money. An individual person who owes debt and cannot pay it can also \"declare bankruptcy\". That person will lose all but some basic things they own, but all the debt will go away. Normally they cannot easily borrow money again for years. Very often, a creditor threatens a debtor with debt slavery, if the debtor does not know that they have a right to go bankrupt. This is a human rights problem in very many countries.",
   "Russia": "Russia (also the Russian Federation) is a country in Europe and Asia. By land area, it is the largest country in the world. The number of people living in the country is about 144,000,000. The Russian Federation is another name for Russia. Russia is now a democratic country. The president is chosen in direct elections, and its current President is Dmitry Medvedev. Its official language is Russian. History. The nation's history began when the East Slavs became a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. The Vikings and their descendants founded and ruled the first East Slavic state of Kievan Rus' in the 9th century.They adopted Christianity from the Byzantine Empire in 988 which influenced Russian culture. Kievan Rus' eventually broke up and the lands were divided into many small feudal states. The most powerful successor state to Kievan Rus' was the Grand Duchy of Moscow. This served as the main force in the Russian reunification and struggle against the Golden Horde. Moscow slowly combined the surrounding Russian principalities and dominated the cultural and political legacy of Kievan Rus'. By the 18th century, the nation had expanded through conquest, annexation and exploration to become the Russian Empire. This was the third largest empire in history. It stretched from Poland eastward to the Pacific Ocean and Alaska. From 1922 to 1991 Russia was the largest part in the Soviet Union, or the \"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\" (USSR). People sometimes used the name \"Russia\" for the whole Soviet Union. In reality, Russia was only one of 15 Soviet Socialist Republics and it named as Russian Soviet Socialist Republic. Before then, a king ruled Russia. This king was called a Tsar. In 1917, the Bolsheviks (later called \"Communists\") took over the country and murdered the tsar. The Soviet Union broke apart in 1990-1991. Russia became successor of Soviet Union. And because of that place of USSR in UN come to Russia. Geography. The capital and the biggest city is Moscow. The second biggest city is Saint Petersburg. Other cities in Russia with more than one million people are Literature. Russia contributed many famous literary works. Alexander Pushkin is considered a founder of modern Russian literature. He was a poet from the 19th century. Other famous poets and writers of the 19th century are Anton Chekhov, Mikhail Lermontov, Leo Tolstoy, Nikolai Gogol, Ivan Turgenev and Fyodor Dostoevsky. Ivan Goncharov, Mikhail Saltykov, Aleksey Pisemsky, and Nikolai Leskov. Tolstoy and Dostoevsky were considered by many critics as the greatest novelists ever. Sports. Since the 1952 Olympic Games, Soviet and later Russian athletes are in the top three in gold medals collected at the Summer Olympics. The 1980 Summer Olympic Games were held in Moscow while the 2014 Winter Olympics will be hosted by Sochi. Religion. The most common religion in Russia is Christianity.

   "Definition": "A definition is an exact word or phrase of the meaning, nature, or limits of something. A definition usually answers the question \"what\". \"Defining\" means giving a definition. Other words with this meaning are \"description\" and \"explanation\". In mathematics, a definition is an exact way of saying what something is. It might not be the easiest way to say what it is, but it is used because it is exact. It can be used in a mathematical proof about the thing.",
   "Regime": "A regime is the leader and other people who run a government of a sovereign state. There are many kinds of regimes. They can achieve power in many ways. Depending on the time and place and local civics like the electoral system, they can lose power in many ways too. The most common way for a regime to lose power was a coup, invasion or revolution until the 20th century. After that it became very dangerous and difficult to use these methods. Peaceful regime change is usually by an election - this method is now used by more than half the people on the Earth. It is called representative democracy. Such regimes are often called administrations to make it clear they are not dictators, and since the executive branch does not have all the power itself - it may share it with a legislative branch. Also the judicial branch is separate. The courts are not usually considered part of the regime. When many regimes negotiate at the United Nations or World Trade Organization, it does not matter at all how each regime got its power. It matters only that they can agree and make everyone in their country do as the agreement says. When someone wants a regime to change in another country, they usually are not able to do this by any means other than violence or interfering in its election. This is common if a regime is threatened by another regime.",
   "Roman Empire": "\"For Roman emperors, see Roman emperors.\" The Roman Empire was a very big empire with its capital in Rome, ruled by an emperor. The first emperor of Rome was Octavian, from the year 27 B.C.E. Before that, Rome had been a Republic ruled by a council called the \"Senate.\" Many modern countries are on land that was once part of the Roman Empire, including England (without Scotland), Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Germany, Egypt, and the north coast of Africa. The language of the Roman Empire was Latin. The western part of the Roman Empire continued for almost 1000 years, and the eastern part, including Greece and Turkey, continued for about a thousand years more. The eastern part was called the Byzantine Empire with a capital at Constantinople. In order to control their large empire, the Romans developed important ideas about law and government. Many emperors had absolute control, and could do as they pleased. When the emperor died, his favorite friend whom he had adopted as a son often became the next emperor, since many of them never had sons of their own. After a while, the emperors grew so weak that the military would just pick one of their generals to be the next emperor. Many times they would have civil wars to see which general was the most powerful. The Romans fought many wars against other countries, and enjoyed watching violent sports. They enjoyed watching races between chariots pulled by horses, and fights between men using weapons (gladiators). Unlike modern sports, the fighters were often killed in these fights. They enjoyed these shows in the Roman Colosseum. The Romans built many big buildings, aqueducts to carry water, and very good stone bridges and roads. Some of these things can still be seen today. Many famous writers were also Romans, including Cicero and Virgil. The New Testament of the Bible tells about the Romans in the life of Jesus Christ. During Jesus' life, the Romans, who were pagan controlled his country. Later, several emperors tried to destroy Christianity in any way possible, but they could not. The people were becoming Christian, even though the pagan emperors called themselves gods. By 312 C.E., the emperor Galerius allowed people freedom to follow Christianity, and the next year, a Christian general, named Constantine, defeated the pagans and became emperor over what was already a largely Christian land. The main coin of the Roman Empire was the denarius. It was spent often by the wealthy, often on luxuries. The city of Rome was taken over several times by barbarians, notably in 410 C.E. when the Goths sacked, or stole the goods of, the city. The last Western Roman emperor, Romulus Augustulus, resigned in 476 C.E. The Roman Empire would last another 1,000 years as the Byzantine Empire in the east.",
   "Jargon": "Jargon is a special way to use words that are shared only by a certain group of people. They do not mean what the dictionary says they mean. They have different meanings to the people using them than their everyday meaning. For example, the ordinary words boot, net, and web also have special meanings for users of computers, the Internet, and the World Wide Web. These, and to flame, to ping and many acronyms are part of net jargon. An \"acronym\" means that only some of the letters in the word or phrase are used. Often this is the first letter of each word. Other acronyms found online are simply common shorthand. See list of slang words. Usually, more jargon is created over time. Jargon is also common in the military. It includes phrases like SNAFU. Jargon can be used by a clique to prevent others from joining or understanding, but it also is often just used because it is shorter.",
   "Freedom": "Freedom, for people, means not being owned or controlled by anyone else. The best way to describe it is as the opposite of \"slavery\". Special cases. Freedom does not always mean that people do as they want. There are many things that may not let people do that. So freedom is a very political and philosophical idea. A difficult problem is that sometimes people make bad choices. They may make choices which stop them doing things they want to do later. If they had not been free to make the bad choice, they \"would\" have be able to do the things they wanted later. So, some people think that it is sometimes OK to control someone else, if it helps that person do things they want in the end. For example, it is okay to say that a child who wants to get a good job must go to school, because when the child grows up, they will be able to get that job. Or, if a person has decided they do not want to drink alcohol and drive, it is okay to stop them driving if they drink. Because of this, some philosophers (like Isaiah Berlin) think there are two kinds of freedom. They say that not being owned or controlled by anyone else is called \"negative freedom\" or \"freedom from\". They believe that there is another kind of freedom called \"positive freedom\", or \"freedom to\". Positive freedom is the ability to do all of the things that you can and want to do. Some people also say that we should stop a person driving if they drink because they might get hurt - even if the person \"did\" want to drink and drive. Or we should make a child go to school even if they do not want to get a good job in the end, because they might change their mind when they grow up. These may be good ideas, but they are not \"positive freedom\". It is only \"positive freedom\" if you control the person now to help them do something that they want to do later, and you know for sure that they want to do it. These ideas are called \"paternalism\", where you control a person now to do something that you want them to do later, or that you think they should do. \"Paternalism\" makes a person less free, but it can make their life better, which is another hard question. Freedom today. Today, freedom is felt by many to be something that all human beings have from birth, and a natural right. This means that one is free by the fact that they are a human being. As humans, everyone has dignity that must be respected. Types of freedom. Some of the main types of human freedom are: freedom to life, freedom of association, freedom of belief, freedom to express oneself, freedom to choose one's state in life. However, the civil constitutions of each country have different definitions of the freedoms allowed to the citizens. It has been argued that any law limits freedom, since it sets limits on what people may do.",

The goal of General semantics is for people to know that when we simplify something, either mentally or in language, that simplification is not the same thing as the thing simplified. How people understand reality is not the same as what reality is because people do not know everything about reality. General semantics teaches that there is always more to something than what is seen, heard, felt, or believed.",

   "Houseplant": "A houseplant is any kind of decorative plant. People grow them indoors, usually in a house, where these plants gets their name.",
   "Product stewardship": "Product stewardship includes waste disposal measures in the distribution chain of an industrial product. That is, paying for the safe and proper disposal when you pay for the product, and relying on those who sold it to you, to dispose of it. The slightly more specific idea of product take-back means that the service of waste disposal is paid for at time of purchase. It is often applied to paint, tires, and other goods that become toxic waste if not disposed of properly. It is most familiar as the deposit bottle - where one pays for the loan of the bottle at the same time as one purchases what is inside it. The container deposit charged for a deposit bottle may be a fee to \"buy\" the bottle, separately from the fee to buy what it contains. If one returns the bottle, the fee is returned, and the supplier must return the bottle for re-use or recycling. If not, one has paid the fee, and presumably this can pay for landfill or litter control measures that dispose of say a broken bottle. Also, since the same fee can be collected by anyone finding and returning the bottle, it is common for people to collect these and return them as a means of surviving. This is quite common for instance among homeless people in U.S. cities. This principle is applied very broadly beyond bottles to paint and automobile parts such as tires. When purchasing paint or tires in many places, one simultaneously pays for the disposal of the toxic waste they become. In some countries, such as Germany, law requires attention to the comprehensive outcome of the whole extraction, production, distribution, use and waste of a product, and holds those profiting from these legally responsible for any outcome along the way. This is also the trend in the UK and EU generally. In the United States, there have been many class action suits that are effectively product stewardship liability - holding companies responsible for things the product does, which it was never advertised to do. Rather than let liability for these problems be taken up by the public sector or be haphazardly assigned one issue at a time to companies via lawsuits, many accounting reform efforts focus on achieving full cost accounting. This is the financial reflection of the comprehensive outcome - noting the gains and losses to all parties involved, not just those investing or purchasing. Such moves have made moral purchasing more attractive, as it avoids liability and future lawsuits. So these are partial implementations of a strict service economy ideal. Those who advocate these measures are concerned with the later phases of product lifecycle and the comprehensive outcome of the whole production process. It is considered a pre-requisite to a strict service economy interpretation of (fictional, national, legal) \"commodity\" and \"product\" relationships.",

   "Probability": "Probability is a part of mathematics. It is to do with chance, the study of things that might happen or might not happen. For example, using probability, you can show that if you throw a coin up in the air and let it land, half of the time it will land with one side facing up, and half the time with the other side facing up. Many coins have a picture of the face of a famous person on one side, and something else on the other side. Often people call the side with the face \"heads\", and the other side \"tails\". The probability (p) of an event is always between zero (impossible) and one (certain). If we roll a die (plural: dice), then the chance that it will land on 1 is 1/6 (This is because there are 6 numbers on a die). Also, the chance it will land on 2 is 1/6. This is because it can land on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The chance of any number between 1 and 6 landing is 1. Every time we roll the die, it will always land on a number between 1 and 6.",

People try to use these measurements to determine what the weather will be like in the future. These people are called \"meteorologists\".",
   "Food": "Food is material of animal or plant origin, eaten by living things to provide energy and nutrition. Food contains the nutrition that people need to be healthy. People need to eat protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals to be healthy. Liquids used for energy and nutrition are often called \"drinks\". Food for humans is mostly made through farming or gardening, and includes animal and vegetable sources. Some people refuse to eat food from animal origin, like meat, eggs and products with milk in them. Not eating meat is called vegetarianism. Not eating or using any animal products is called veganism). Food produced by farmers or gardeners can be transformed by industrial processes (the food industry). Processed food usually contains several natural ingredients and food additives (such as preservative, antioxidants, emulsifiers, flavour enhancers, etc.). At home, food is prepared in the kitchen, by the cook. The cook sometimes uses a cookbook. Examples of cooking utensils are pressure cooker, pot, and pan. Food can also be prepared and served in restaurants (often workers, or in the evening for entertainment) or refectory (in particular for kids in school). The utensils used may be a plate, knife, fork, chopsticks, spoon, bowl, or spork. Most people do not grow their own food, so they have to buy food that was grown by someone else. People buy most of their food in stores, shops, or markets. But some people still grow most or all of their own food. People may buy food and take it home to cook it, or buy food that is ready to eat from a street vendor, or in a restaurant. Food-related issues. Food shortage is still a big problem in the world today. Many people do not have enough money to buy the food that they need. Bad weather or other problems sometimes destroy the growing food in one part of the world. When people do not have enough food, we say that they are hungry. If they do not eat enough food for a long time, they will become sick and die from starvation. In areas where many people do not have enough food, we say that there is famine there. Food can make people sick if it is contaminated by micro-organisms, heavy metals, or chemicals. If people do not eat the right foods, they can become sick. If people do not eat enough protein, they get the disease called kwashiorkor. If they do not eat enough vitamin B1 (thiamine), they get the disease called beriberi. If people eat too much food, they can become overweight or obese. This is also bad for people's health. Food in religions. Many cultures or religions have food taboos. That means they have rules what people should not eat, or how the food has to be prepared. Examples of religious food rules are the \"Kashrut\" of Judaism and the \"Halal\" of Islam, which say that pig meat cannot be eaten.",
   "Work": "When used in a sentence as an action, work means doing something that requires labor. When used in a sentence as an object, work means something that remains to be done. A worker is any person that does work, often in exchange for money or helpful services (these workers that receive money or helpful services are said to be \"holding a job\"). In science, an equation for the total amount of work produced from a force is Work = force x distance. The phrase \"work ethic\" is used to explain how hard a person works, and what his or her attitude towards work is.",
   "Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg": "Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg is a federal state in Germany. It has an area of 35 752 km\u00b2 and a population of nearly 11 million people. The capital is Stuttgart. The Minister President is G\u00fcnther Oettinger of the (CDU). It is the third biggest state in Germany. Only Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia have more people living there. The federal state is located in the southwest of Germany. It shares borders to the east with the state of Bavaria, to the north with the states of Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate, to the west with the country of France (along the River Rhine) and to the south with the countries Switzerland and Austria. History. In 1952, the three states of Baden, W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern joined together to found Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Politics. The Minister President is the chief of the government of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The government is made up of ministers and state secretaries. Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg is a conservative minded state. The CDU is the main political party in the state, and since 1953, the Ministers President have all been members of the CDU. Between the years 1972 and 1992, the members of the Landtag of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg were mostly members of the CDU. But the state is also a stronghold of the \"Gr\u00fcnen\" which were founded in the early 1980s in Karlsruhe. The election results of the Gr\u00fcnen in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg have always been above the election average for the party in Germany. Tourism. The Black forest, the Swabian Alb and the Lake Constance are world famous holiday regions. The highest mountain is the Feldberg (1492m). Other important cities in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg besides the capital city of Stuttgart are: Freiburg, Heidelberg, Rastatt, Karlsruhe, Mannheim, Ulm and Heilbronn. The Danube, the Neckar and the Rhine are important rivers which are located in the state. Religion. In the northern part of W\u00fcrttemberg and the Kurpfalz the majority are Protestants. But the other parts of the state, especially the south, the majority are Roman Catholics. Sports. Football is the most popular sport in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The best clubs are the VfB Stuttgart and the Karlsruher SC (Karlsruher SC or KSC).",
   "License": "In British English spelling a licence gives permission (allows) something. Usually a licence is written. The laws of most countries say that you are only allowed to drive a car if you have a licence. Other licences give permission to shoot animals (often called a hunting licence) or allow someone to have a television set - in the UK and Ireland and \"television licence\" has to be bought every year. In many countries, if a person tries to do something without the correct licence to do it, he might have to pay a fine or go to prison. A person or a company can also give a licence. When someone buys a computer software application, they also buy a licence from the creator of the software allowing the buyer to use it. \"License\" is a verb. \"Licensing sessions\" were the meetings of magistrates which decided about giving licences to sell alcohol. In American English spelling there is no difference in spelling between the verb \"to license\" meaning to give permission, and \"a licence\" meaning the permission to do something.",
   "You": "You is a second-person English pronoun. The word can be singular or plural. It is what a person says when he or she is addressing another person in second person.",
   "Human death": "Human death is the end of sharable human personal experience - if anything happens to us after death, we are not able to clearly communicate it. Such rituals as a seance claim to be able to speak to the dead but this is not claimed to be very reliable, even by those who do them very often. What is our death? Death occurs to every life form and it means the mind, senses and body stopping. If there is some other part to life such as soul, that could continue without a body (afterlife), move into another body (reincarnation), or just go away. Religions have different beliefs about this issue. The medical view of the body is that it is like an animal body and in some ways like a machine. This is a powerful way to see the body because it lets it be \"diagnosed\" and sometimes \"fixed\". However this is part of a mechanistic paradigm with other effects - one of which is a refusal to admit that it may often be better to die than live. Modern healing protocols like palliative care allow for this, and for the idea of \"dying healed\" which would make no sense if one thinks of healing as only about cures. What happens after death? When human killing is the cause of a human death, usually family members or friends or the state (claiming to act on their behalf or that of others who might be next) seek what can be called revenge or harms reduction by locking-up or killing the human killer. Also, when animals kill humans, they too are almost always caught and killed. It is considered a very bad thing to let animals taste human flesh, or to have the experience of killing one. In any society, human death is surrounded by ritual - a wake or funeral is normal. In some places it was common to \"eat\" the dead in a form of ritual cannibalism. But this is no longer common, in part because disease like kuru can be passed this way. Human dead bodies are taboo in most societies and must be handled in special ways - for a combination of religious and hygiene reasons. A human dead body must always be reported in law, to be sure it is disposed of properly. There are always some consequences or requirements for dealing with a human death. Cover-ups. Hiding a human death is considered very bad - almost as bad as homicide itself. One of the reasons Slobodan Milosevic and Saddam Hussein are said to have committed crimes against humanity is mass graves that were found in Bosnia and Iraq, which contained many people who opposed them. Today some people continue to deny that Adolf Hitler killed millions of Jews, gypsies, homosexuals and political opponents in his death camps during World War II - this phenomenon is called Holocaust denial. Cover ups are frequent in the mafia and other organized crime. Probably the worst cases of mass death in living memory are the Rwanda genocide and The Killing Fields of Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge; each of killed approximately half of the population. Dealing with dead bodies and their property. Finding the cause of any human death, and stopping a similar death from happening to someone else, are the main reasons people look into \"human morbidity\", or let dead bodies be cut open and looked at in an autopsy. Some religions do not allow autopsies, because they feel the body is holy. Autopsies are usually required by the state if someone dies and people do not know why. The autopsy helps find out if someone killed the person on purpose, or tried to hurt them, or if they died from a sickness. To prepare for their own death, humans can write a last will and testament to be clear about who gets their property. A person will sometimes also volunteer to be an organ donor. This might mean giving the whole body to medical research. It can also save the lives of others by making organ transplants possible. Religious views of death. Ancient rulers sometimes did insist not only that their own bodies, and much property, but even their servants and relatives be destroyed at their funeral. In India this ritual still does sometimes occur. Old women sometimes carry guns in case their husband's relatives come to throw them on the funeral fire. Christianity has a special focus on death because of the state killing of Jesus Christ by the Romans. In Islam this is thought to demonstrate the injustice of human systems of dealing out death, and the ability of the best people to overcome it and even forgive it. In Christianity itself it is thought to prove that Jesus himself was really God and so could lose his body to show something and still have power. In Buddhism every being is thought to have this power, and reincarnation will occur until the being reaches enlightenment and can escape the wheel of life to reach Nirvana. Reincarnation is an idea taken from Hinduism of course. Confucianism advises filial piety and forms of ancestor worship to respect both dead and living ancestors, who created your body and taught you ethics. Rituals surrounding death. Every ethical tradition including the medical view of the body has some ritual surrounding death. Often these excuse behaviours that might be hated if they did not have the ritual. For instance, one may say that organ transplant is like cannibalism. Very much of what happens at a human death is ritual. People who wish theirs to be dealt with a certain way, and who wish a particular treatment like cremation of their body, should decide in advance and set up the necessary payments and agreements. This makes it much easier for their family after they die, since there is no longer the ability to clearly communicate the wish. For the same reason, saying goodbye is important. Most of the stress of death seems to come for loved ones who \"did not have a chance to say goodbye\". Maybe it is to relieve this stress that rituals are created, and to bring together those that knew someone so that the personal experience a person can no longer communicate for themselves, can be exchanged by others. Preparing for death. Because events leave living memory, and may only be part of oral tradition, there are projects to record everything that people remember about World War I and the Shoah. The first of these was to record everything remembered about the U.S. Civil War. This discipline has changed history since we have so many more first person accounts of the times, and made social history much more standard.",
   "Tragedy": "A tragedy is a sad thing. In theatre, a tragedy is a play that ends sadly. A tragedy is usually about a person who has many good qualities, but has one bad quality (called a \"tragic flaw\") that causes trouble for him, and may cause him, or his family or friends, to be in trouble. Often in a tragedy, there is one thing that the hero does not want to happen and tries to prevent, but no matter what he does, it makes this thing more and more sure to happen. They originated in Ancient Greece where they were performed at religious festivals. The three most famous Greek tragedy writers were Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides.",
   "Magnifying glass": "A magnifying glass is a lens through which you can look to make things appear bigger, so you can see them better. The magnifying glass consists of a piece of convex-shaped glass or plastic. It has to be held at the right distance between the eye and the object. The magnifying glass usually comes with a handle. A telescope is a more advanced kind of magnifying glass and consists of at least two glass lenses. A pair of binoculars is like a telescope for each eye. \"Spectacles\" or eyeglasses also use lenses to correct a person's vision.",
   "Ottawa, Ontario": "Ottawa is the capital of Canada and is part of the province of Ontario. It is south of the Ottawa River. The population in 2004 was about 808,391 people in the city itself. The region has about 1,146,790 people in it. The mayor of the city today (2006) is Larry O'Brien. It is located in the Ottawa Valley and is the fourth largest city in Canada. When one talks about Ottawa, it could also mean the highest government in Canada, and not its local government or the city. The cities of Ottawa, Kanata, Nepean, Gloucester and Vanier and the villages of Manotick and Rockcliffe Park joined in the year 2000 to form the new city of Ottawa. Ottawa also includes Orl\u00e9ans, which joined at that same time.",
   "List of German football teams": "These are the German football teams and the leagues they played in for the 2008/09 season. The highest German league is the Bundesliga (First Division). Below it is the second \"Bundesliga\" (Second Division). The Third Division is called 3. Liga. The Fourth Division, called \"Regionalliga\" is split into a northern, a southern and a western part. The northern part is called \"Regionalliga Nord\", the southern part \"Regionalliga S\u00fcd\" and the western part \"Regionalliga West\".",
   "Home page": "The home page of a web site is the document that a web server sends to another computer's web browser application when it has been contacted without a request for specific information. That is, when you enter only a domain name in the Address box without specifying a directory or a file, the \"home page\" is usually the first part of the web site you will be taken to. The Home Page is also called the Main Page. A properly written home page will tell a user about the information available in the web site, and how to view different parts of the web site. The home page of \"simple.wikipedia.org\" can be found at this link. Home Page was a popular computer application used for composing web pages.",
   "Sound": "We can define a sound wave as a disturbance which travels through some medium. Sound is the term to describe what is heard when sound waves pass through a medium to the ear. Sound is produced by mechanical vibrations. Sound can travel through solids, liquids, and gases, but it cannot travel through a vacuum. The travelling speed of sound in the air is 331.5 m/s at 0 \u00b0C. The speed of sound increases as the temperature of the air increases to 343 m/s at 20 \u00b0C. Sound is a longitudinal wave. It shows reflection, refraction, diffraction, and interference. Audible sound has frequencies between 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Human beings can hear audible sound. Sound waves with frequency above 20 kHz are called ultrasound waves. Sound waves with frequency below 20 Hz are called infrasound waves. Human beings cannot hear ultrasound waves and infrasound waves.",
   "Et cetera": "Et cetera means \"and the rest\" in Latin. It is often used in English to continue a list that is longer than what can be normally written. People most often write \"et cetera\" as etc. Very rarely, it is also written \"&c\" because the ampersand, or the \"&\", is the same as \"et\". It is also the symbol for \"and\". Some people write it as \"ect\", but that is wrong.",
   "Kimono": "Kimonos (\u7740\u7269) are traditional Japanese clothes. \"Kimono\" meant \"something you wear\" originally. Long ago, people in Japan wore kimonos every day. Now, people only wear a kimono for special occasions such as formal ceremonies. A kimono is a robe shaped like a \"T\". Normal kimonos reaches to the ankles, and has very long sleeves. Kimonos for women have usually colorful design of flowers, butterflies, etc. People wear a wide belt called an \"obi\" with their kimono. Obi are also colorful. Women's kimonos are all the same size. They fold them and tuck them to make them the right size. People who are very tall or heavy have to have kimonos made for them. There are different types of formal and casual kimono. Kimonos are usually made of silk, but there are cotton and polyester kimonos as well. Kimonos are very expensive. One woman's kimono can cost more than US$10,000. The obi (belts) are very expensive too. They can cost thousands of dollars. Most people's kimonos are not so expensive. Some people make their own kimono, or buy them second hand. Japanese people have been wearing kimonos for hundreds of years. Today, kimonos are worn only at special times. More women wear kimonos than men. Men wear kimonos most often at weddings and Japanese tea ceremonies. Men's kimonos are made of \"haori\" (top) and \"hakama\" (loose-fitting pants). People who play some sports like kendo also wear kimono. They are tough, thick and short, not like typical women's kimono. They are usually called \"do-gi\". In Japan people can take classes about wearing kimonos and learn about how to choose kimonos and how to tie the obi. Most Japanese women do not know how to put on a kimono by themselves because it is very difficult. Some people work as \"kimono dressers\". They help people to put on their kimono. Some people still wear kimonos every day in Japan.",
   "Crime": "A crime is when a person does something that is against the laws of a country. A person who does this is called a criminal. The basic idea of what things are called crimes is that they are thought to be things that might cause a problem for another person. Things like killing another person, injuring another person, or stealing from another person are crimes in most countries. But different countries have many different ideas of what things are crimes. Some things that are crimes in one country are not crimes in other countries. Many countries get their ideas of what things are crimes from religions. In many countries, if people say they made or wrote a book, movie, song, or Web page that they didn't really write or make, it is a crime against the laws of copyright. In many countries, helping to grow, make, move, or sell illegal drugs is a crime. In most countries, police try to stop crimes and to find criminals. When the police find someone who they think might be a criminal, they usually hold the person in a jail. Then, usually, a court or a judge decides if the person really did a crime. If the court or judge decides that the person really did it, then he or she might have to pay a fine or go to prison. Sometimes the judge might decide that the criminal should be executed (killed). This is called Capital punishment (or the \"Death Penalty\"). There are countries in the world who execute criminals, and others who do not. When some criminals make money from crime, they try to stop the police finding out where the money came from by money laundering.",
   "Terrestrial ecoregion": "In ecology, a terrestrial ecoregion is a certain area of land which is different from the area near it. It has a distinct climate, geology, type of soil, water availability, and distinct living species (the animals and plants that live in the ecoregion). For example, one ecoregion can be a desert. It would have sand, very little water, very hot temperatures during the day and very cold at night. The plants could be just bushes, small trees, cactii. The animals could be scorpions, little mammals, spiders. Or for example, an ecoregion could be a tropical forest It would have warm temperatures all day, a lot of rainfall all year, a huge river crossing, and a very organic soil. The plants could be huge trees or ferns. The animals could be insects, birds, fish and apes. An ecoregion is likely to be about 100 km square. Marine ecoregions are similar, but are located in the oceans or fresh waters.",
   "Crucible": "In chemistry, a crucible is a kind of laboratory apparatus that is usually a cup, made of porcelain or non-reactive metal, used to heat chemical compounds to very high temperatures. One of the earliest uses of platinum was as a material in crucibles. Metals such as nickel and zirconium are also used as crucible materials these days.",
   "Miracle": "For example, a miracle under the first definition would be winning the lottery jackpot. A person who wins a state lottery would think it's a miracle that he won a lottery jackpot, but this would involve no violation of the laws of nature. People often win the lottery, but it is not very likely that he would. A miracle under the second definition would be like a person being able to leap a tall building in a single bound. A violation of the physical law of gravity would have occurred. A miracle under the third definition would be a divine intervention by God, where God's presence would be known during a miracle. The Bible, Koran, Mahabarata and the Avesta contains many references to this definition of miracle. An example from the Bible would be a man crippled since birth getting up and walking after Jesus told him to do so.",
   "Engineering": "Engineering is the use of science and mathematics to design or make things. Engineers usually design or build things that are sold or given to people. There are different types of engineers that design everything from computers and buildings to watches and websites. People who do engineering are called engineers. They learn engineering by studying at a university or technical school. Study. Most Engineers are very clever. They are also trained with limited things such as budget and material. American Courses. In the United States, most engineers go to a college or university to get an engineering degree. Most people go to school for four years to get a Bachelor's degree in engineering. A Master's Degree is an advanced degree, usually requiring two more years of study after the Bachelors. A person with a Master's degree is eligible to enter a Doctoral program in engineering. A graduate of a Doctoral program is awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree, which is commonly called a PhD. A PhD in engineering requires three or four years of study after a Master's degree, and includes the completion of a long research report called a dissertation. British Courses. In the United Kingdom, engineering degrees at universities are either 3 year BEng (Bachelor of Engineering) or 4 year MEng (Master of Engineering). Engineers can also get additional recognition in the form of Chartership. In many universities it is common to take only one engineering discipline (e.g. aeronautical or civil engineering) although some universities have a general engineering degree. French Courses. The best way to become an engineer in France is to take the CPGE (Classe Preparatoire pour les Grandes Ecoles is the French class for engineer's school) for two years and then three years in an \"Ecole d'Ing\u00e9nieur\" (Engineer's school). You could also study in an IUT (Institut universitaire technologique) for three years, then by three years in an \"Ecole d'Ing\u00e9nieur\"",
   "Supernatural": "The word supernatural is used for things that some people believe are real, but that are not part of nature. Because we cannot prove whether these things are real, people often disagree about these things. Scientists say that we should talk about things without talking about the supernatural, because we cannot prove that supernatural things are real. Other people say that although we cannot prove supernatural things in a scientific way, they are real. Many ideas like religion, magic, miracles, spirits, ghosts, angels, devils, gods, and God are supernatural. Fiction. In comic books, the superhero is a person with supernatural abilities and tries to hide them. In books, a character (Usually Fantasy, or Science fiction) has some sort of supernatural powers. For example: A witch who can cast magic.",
   "Derivative": "A derivative is something created from a primary source, and can mean different things.",
   "Gene": "Genes are a part of DNA. DNA is a collection of chemical information that carries all of the instructions for making all the proteins a cell will ever need. Each gene contains a single set of instructions. These instructions are usually thecoding for a particular protein. Half of a person's genes come from the mother. The other half come from the father. Genes are passed on from parent to child and are an important part of what decides the biological properties (how they look and act) of offspring (children). Genes affect the way our bodies work, including how we look. So our eye, hair and skin color is caused by genes. It is said that genes cause \"genetic\" effects in our bodies. Sometimes, a gene is 'dominant'. Sometimes, it is 'recessive'. What this means is that some genes have a better chance of showing up in a child. For example, let's say a mother has brown hair and a father has red hair. Brown hair is more common than red hair, so usually, the brown hair gene is going to be dominant and the red hair gene is going to be recessive. The dominant gene has a better chance of making it to the child, so if these parents have a child, it will probably have brown hair. But sometimes, the recessive gene makes it to the child. The child may have red hair. A recessive gene might stay hidden for many generations. Let's use the parents from last example. But, the mother's mother (the grandmother) has blonde (yellow) hair. This gene did not show up on the mother because the mother has brown hair. But, the child might have blonde hair! This is because the blonde gene was recessive in this family, but came back a generation later. This explains why a person might look different from their parents, but look like their grandparents or great grandparents.",
   "Principal": "A principal is a person who is in charge of something. The person can be in charge of a school, or a research project, or a business setting.",
   "Unit": "Unit means part of something. It could mean a unit of measurement, or a unit in an army. Units sometimes means the digit in a number on the right, which is also called the \"ones\". For example, a football team may be called \"X United\". This means that the town of X has come together to support the group. \"Unit\" is also slang for the male penis in some countries.",
   "Prediction": "A prediction is a statement that someone makes about what they think is going to happen. It is often very helpful to know what is going to happen to help prepare for these future events. Predictions are based on the idea that two beginning positions that are like each other will have similar results. By watching something happen, it is possible to predict what will happen if something similar happens. Predictions are given by science or fortune tellers or horoscopes. The most common example of a prediction is the weather forecast. Studying how weather happens lets people predict what the weather will be by looking at what is currently happening. This is helpful because by knowing that it is going to rain, a person can wear the right clothes for it. Nostradamus has made many predictions about future.",
   "Brussels": "Brussels (,) is the capital city of Belgium and the European Union. In 2007 its population, the people living in it, was 145,917. But the area around it, known as the Brussels-Capital Region, had 1,031,215 people (which makes it the largest city area in Belgium). The people in Brussels used to only speak Flemish (a type of Dutch) but more and more people speaking French moved there and now French is spoken more than Dutch. But there are lots of other languages spoken as well since the European Union based its offices in the city. \"Brussels sprouts\" are named after the city and it is also where many popular comics in Europe originated (Tintin, The Smurfs, Snorks, Lucky Luke). It is also well known for a style of building know as \"Art Nouveau\", its waffles and its chocolates. The city is located at 50\u00b0 50 North, 04\u00b0 21 East.",
   "Zoo": "A zoological garden, zoological park, or zoo is a place where many different species (types) of animals are kept so people can see and watch them. Modern zoos try not only to be for people's entertainment, but for education, research, and the conservation and protection of animals. Many zoos are centers where rare animals are preserved when they are in danger of dying out. These modern zoos also want to give the animals a natural life, so that they are healthy and behave normal. This is done for the animals, but also that people can see the animals as if they were in nature, and not in a zoo. In the past, but also today, there are a lot of zoos that are not like the modern type of zoo. There the animals are held in very bad conditions. They are kept in small cages, and they are bored and get sick.",

Most Finns speak Finnish language as their mother tongue. Some 6% of Finns have Swedish language as their mother tongue. Most Finns have also have studied some other language, like English language in school. Most Finns work either in services (that is: shops, banks, offices or businesses) or in factories. Finns often like saunas and nature. Many Finnish families have a summer cottage, a small house where they go to relax on their summer holiday. The most important parties that Finnish people celebrate are Midsummer and Christmas. Santa Claus is an old Finnish tradition, although later the Coca-Cola company introduced him to the world. In North America some children think he lives near the north pole. In Finland and neighbouring countries, he lives in a small mountain called Korvatunturi (\"Ear mountain\"). The most popular sports in Finland are ice hockey, skiing and track and field. Recently Finns have also won many events in swimming and motor sports. There is a very small group (minority) of Sami (also called Lapp) people in the most northern part of Finland called Lapland. Many sami people have reindeer and colourful clothes. in the past the Sami were nomads, but now they live in regular houses.

Permanent snow falls in Helsinki in early December (in Lapland it can fall already in October) and in the winter the temperature can be -30 \u00b0C. The winter usually lasts to mid-March when the snow melts away in Helsinki (in Lapland the snow usually melts away in early May), and spring to late May. Springs are vigorous and the weather can vary from frost to sunshine in a matter of days. Northern lights are common in Lapland. History of Finland. People first came to Finland 10 000 years ago. That was just after an ice age, just after very thick ice that was on ground had melted away. Some think the first people in Finland already spoke a language that is related to Finnish that is spoken today. We know for sure that early form of Finnish language was spoken in Finland in the Iron age. (The Iron Age was in Finland 2500-800 years ago). First people killed wild animals and ate them, but did not farm their food. Those kind of people are called \"hunter-gatherers\". Some people started to farm to make some food 5200 years ago. Farming slowly became more and more popular and became the major way of life until the modern age. The religion of Finnish people was paganism. The biggest god of Finns was Ukko. He was a god of sky and thunder. About a thousand years ago some Finns changed their religion to Christianity, and slowly Christianity became more and more popular. Some pagan beliefs still remained amongst the Christian beliefs. During the Reformation of Christianity most Finnish people became protestants. From the Middle ages Finland was a part of Sweden. Then in year 1809 AD Russia took Finland from Sweden. Then Finland was a part of Russia, but Finland was autonomic, which means Finns could make decisions about many things in Finland. Finns could make their own laws and Finland had their own money (called markka), their own stamps and own customs. However Finland did not have its own army. Then in 1917, Finland became independent, it was no longer a part of Russia. There was a communist revolution in Russia and after 1922 Russia was a part of the Soviet Union. There were communists in Finland too, and they tried to make revolution in Finland. This attempt of revolution caused Finnish civil war. Communists lost the civil war, and Finland remained its old capitalist system. Stalin who was leader of the Soviet Union did not like that there was a capitalist country as the neighbour. Stalin wanted Finland to turn to communist state and be a part of the Soviet Union. Leaders of Finland refused; they wanted to stay independent. Soviet Union sent many troops to Finland to try to make Finland join it. This was the Winter war. There were many fights, and Finnish soldiers won many times. Finally, the leaders of both countries agreed to make peace. Finland was not joined with the Soviet Union, but had to give away some land to make the peace. Parts of Karelia were with those areas lost to Soviet Union. Adolf Hitler was a chief in Germany, and he wanted to invade Soviet Union. Finland wanted its lost areas back, so Finland joined the German invasion, that started at 1941. This part of Second world war is called Continuation war in Finland. However, Finland was not fascist or antisemitist country. Finns were interested in freedom and not dictatorship. Finnish Jews fought with other Finnish people against Soviet Union. Karelia was returned to Finland. While Germany was losing the war Finland wanted to stop fighting. Finland made peace with Soviet Union, but in that peace Finland lost parts of Karelia again. Also peace with Soviet Union made Finland and Germany enemies. Finns fought Germans, and Germans retreated to Norway. This is called War of Lapland. Finland remained independent. After the war, there were many factories built in Finland. Many people moved from farms to cities. At that time, big factories made things like paper, ships and steel. Now more and more people work on more advanced things, like high technology. Also, more people go to a university to get a good education. Finland was one of the first countries where most people had Internet connections and mobile phones. A known company that makes mobile phones, Nokia, is from Finland. Finland joined European Union in 1995. Finnish money markka was changed to European Unions money Euro in 2002.",
   "Verb": "A verb is a kind of word (see part of speech) that usually tells about an action or a state and is the main part of a sentence. Every sentence has a verb. In English, verbs are the only kind of word that changes to show past or present tense. Every language in the world has verbs, but they are not always used in the same ways. They also can have different properties in different languages. For example, in some other languages (e.g., Chinese & Indonesian) verbs do not change for past and present tense. This means the definition above only works well for English verbs. There are sixteen verbs used in Basic English. They are: \"be, do, have, come, go, see, seem, give, take, keep, make, put, send, say, let, get.\" History of the word \"verb\". The word \"verb\" originally comes from \"*were-\", a Proto-Indo-European word meaning \"a word\". It comes to English through the Latin \"verbum\" and the Old French \"verbe\". Verb forms. In English and many other languages, verbs change their form. This is called inflection. Most English verbs have six inflected forms (see the table), but \"be\" has eight different forms. You should notice that some of the verb forms look the same. You can say they have the same shape. For example, the plain present and the plain form of \"walk\" have the same shape. The same is true for the past and the past participle. But these different forms can have different shapes in other verbs. For example, the plain present of \"be\" is usually \"are\" but the plain form is \"be\". Also, the past of \"eat\" is \"ate\", but the past participle is \"eaten\". When you look for a verb in the dictionary, it is usually the plain form that you look for. An English sentence must have at least one primary-form verb. Each main clause can only have one primary-form verb. Kinds of Verbs. English has two main kinds of verbs: normal verbs (called lexical verbs) and auxiliary verbs. The difference between them is mainly in where they can go in a sentence. Some verbs are in both groups, but there are very few auxiliary verbs in English. There are also two kinds of auxiliary verbs: modal verbs and non-modal verbs. The table below shows most of the English auxiliaries and a small number of other verbs. Auxiliary verbs also inflect for negation. Usually this is done by adding \"n't\". Tense, aspect, and mood. Many people think that all different ways of using verbs are all different tenses. This is not true. There are three main systems related to the verb: tense, aspect, and mood. Tense. Tense is mainly used to say when the verb happens: in the past, present, or future. Some languages have all three tenses, some have only two, and some have no tenses at all. English and Japanese for example have only two tenses: past and present. Chinese and Indonesian verbs do not show tense. Instead they use other words in the sentence to show when the verb happens. Aspect. Aspect usually shows us things like whether the action is finished or not, or if something happens regularly. English has two aspects: progressive and perfect. In English, aspect is usually shown by using participle verb forms. Aspect can combine with present or past tense. Progressive aspect. English uses the gerund-participle, usually together with the auxiliary \"be\" to show the progressive aspect. Perfect aspect. English uses the past participle, usually together with the auxiliary \"have\" to show the perfect aspect. The past perfect can be used to express an unrealized hope, wish, etc. After If, wish and would rather, the past perfect can be used to talk about past events that never happened. Mood. Finally, English mood is now usually shown by using modal verbs. In the past, English had a full mood system but that has almost completely disappeared. The subjunctive mood now uses the plain form. There is also a form of \"be\" that is used in conditionals to show that something is not true (e.g., If I were a bird, I would fly to California.) hi my names is magalis i need studing english in the computer online.. can I help you please. Sentence parts that go with verbs. Certain parts of a sentence naturally come before verbs or after them, but these are not always the same for all verbs. The main sentence parts are: subject, object, complement, and modifier. Subjects. Almost all English sentences have subjects, but sentences that are orders (called imperatives) usually don't have any subjects. A subject usually comes before a verb, but it can also come after auxiliary verbs. In the following examples, the subject is underlined and the primary verb is in bold. Objects. Many verbs can be followed by an object. These verbs are called transitive verbs. In fact, some verbs must have an object (e.g., \"take\"), but some verbs never take an object (e.g., \"sleep\"). Verbs that do not take an object are called intransitive verbs. Some verbs can even have two objects. They are called ditransitive verbs. In the following examples, the object is underlined and the primary verb is in bold. Complements. Some verbs can or must be followed by a complement. These verbs are called linking verbs or copula. In the following examples, the complement is underlined and the verb is in bold. Modifiers. Verbs can be modified by various modifiers, mainly adverbs. Note that verbs generally do not need modifiers; it's usually a choice. In the following examples, the adverb is underlined and the verb is in bold. Verbs also commonly take a variety of other modifiers including prepositions. Differences between verbs and other kinds of words. Sometimes a verb and another word can have the same shape. In these cases you can usually see the difference by looking at various properties of the words. Verbs vs. adjectives. Sometimes a verb and an adjective can have the same shape. Usually this happens with participles. For example, the present participle \"interesting\" and the adjective \"interesting\" look the same. Verbs are different from adjectives, though, because they cannot be modified by \"very\", \"more\", or \"most\". For example, you can say \"That is very interesting,\" so you know interesting is an adjective here. But you can't say \"My teacher is very interesting me in math\" because in this sentence \"interesting\" is a verb. On the other hand, if you cannot change the 'be' verb to 'seem' or 'become', it is probably a verb. Verbs vs. nouns. The main differences between these verbs and nouns are: modifiers, number, and object/complement Modifiers. Verbs cannot generally be modified by adjectives and nouns cannot generally be modified by adverbs. So, in \"Running regularly is good for you\", \"running\" is a verb because it is modified by \"regularly\", an adverb. Number. Verbs cannot change for number, so if you can make the word plural, it is a noun, not a verb. For example, \"this drawing is nice\" can change to \"these drawings are nice\", so \"drawing\" is a noun. But \"drawing trees is fun\" cannot change to \"drawings trees is fun\", so it is a verb here. Object/complement. Many verbs can take objects or complements, but nouns can't. So, in \"parking the car is hard\", \"parking\" is a verb because it takes the object \"the car\". But, if you say, \"there's no parking\", parking may be a noun because it doesn't have an object. Verbs vs. prepositions. The main difference between verbs and prepositions is that verbs have a subject. Even if the subject is not written, you can understand what it is. Prepositions do not have a subject.",
   "Chemical element": "A chemical element is a substance that cannot be divided into smaller chemical parts. The smallest particle of such an element is an atom. Atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. A pure element contains only one kind of atom. The number of protons in the atoms of an element is known as that element's atomic number. For example, all atoms with 6 protons in their nuclei are of the chemical element carbon, and all atoms with 92 protons in their nuclei are of the element uranium. 117 different chemical elements are known to modern chemistry. 90 of these elements can be found in nature, and the others can only be made in laboratories. The first man-made element was Technetium in 1937. All man-made elements are radioactive and unstable. Chemical elements are commonly arranged in the periodic table. Atoms of the same element, whose nuclei contain a different number of neutrons, are said to be different isotopes of the element. Chemical elements are also given a unique \"chemical symbol\". Chemical symbols of elements come from their English or Latin names (For example, carbon has the chemical symbol 'C', and sodium has chemical symbol 'Na', after the Latin \"natrium\"). Elements can combine (react) to form pure compounds (such as water, salts, oxides, and organic compounds). In many cases, these compounds have a fixed composition and their own structure and properties. Some elements, particularly metal elements mix together in any proportion to form new structures. Such new structures are not compounds. They are called mixtures. Classification. Elements can be classified based on physical states. At room temperature and pressure, most elements are solids, only 11 are gases and 2 are liquids. Elements can also be classified into metals and non-metals. There are many more metals than non-metals. However, a few elements have properties in between those of metals and non-metals. These elements are called semi-metals (or metalloids).",
   "Search engine": "A Search engine is a web site on the World Wide Web (www) of the Internet that helps us to quickly and easily find the web pages we want. One can put in words on the subject that one is interested in, and the search engine will find pages that have those words in them. Some examples of business search engines are",
   "Wikimedia Foundation": "The Wikimedia Foundation is a non-profit foundation in the United States that coordinates many projects using the wiki idea, and the MediaWiki software. These projects include Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikiquote, Wikisource, Wikinews, Wikibooks, Wikiversity, Wikimedia Commons, and Meta-Wiki. There are many other wikis to do with the foundation, but these are not very important.

   "Unit of measurement": "Measurement is a process to attach a numerical value to an observation. This is done to be able to compare or order two or more such observations. Units of Measurement provide standards to compare against. That way, the metre is the standard unit to measure length. Until it was redefined in 1982, it was defined as the distance between two markers on a certain rod. Now it is defined as the distance light travels in a certain time, in vacuum. Saying something has a length of 2 metres therefore means that its exactly twice as long as that rod used to define the metre, or that light takes twice the time defined for a metre to travel that distance. This also makes it easy to say that something that is 3 metres long is longer than something else, that is only 2 metres long. Today, most units of measure fall into one of two systems. The older, imperial system uses the foot as a mesure of length, the pound as a mesure for weight and the second as a measure for time. There are other units as well. Most of the time 12 or 16 of the smaller unit make the bigger unit. This is difficult to rememver, so there is another system that uses 10 of the smaller unit to make the bigger one. It is known as the \"SI system\" or \"metric system. Is uses the metre for length, the kilogram for weight, and the second for time. Number and Unit of measure. The property of the thing being measured is given as a number of units of measure. The number only has sense when the unit of measurement is also given. For example, The Eiffel Tower in Paris, France is 300 meters tall. That is, the distance from the top to the bottom of the Eiffel Tower is 300 meters. The property of the Eiffel Tower being measured is a distance. The number measured is 300. This number does not make sense without the unit of measure. The unit of measure is the meter. Measurement Standards. Standards are used in measurements. That is, the unit of measurement used to measure a property is the same everywhere and does not change. This makes measurement easier and comparisons between measurements easier. Size of Units of Measurement. There are units of measurement of different sizes. There are small units of measurement to measure small things. There are big units of measurement to measure big things. Science, medicine and engineering use smaller units of measurement to measure small things with less error. It is easier to measure large things using larger units of measurement. Large measurements like the width of a galaxy and small measurements like the mass of an atom use special units of measurement. Systems of Units of Measurement. There are many different standards and units used all over the world. Metric System. The metric system is a system of measurement used in most of the world. It is also called the International System of Units, or SI. Imperial Units. Imperial units were used in countries that were part of the British Empire, however they can be different in different countries. For example the fluid ounce in Britain is smaller than the fluid ounce in the US, but the US gallon is smaller than the British gallon. The imperial units are now used mainly in the United States. While many countries have officially adopted SI, older system of units are still used. In the United States, the metric system has been legal for trade since 1866 but other measurements such as the gallon, inch, and the pound are still widely used. The ounces for weight and volume are different. Even when measuring water, the number of ounces of weight is not the same as the number of fluid ounces. Time. The unit of time is the second. The minute (60 seconds) and hour (60 minutes or 3600 seconds) are larger units. A day is usually said to be 24 hours, but is actually a small bit longer. This difference is corrected at the end of every year. A week (7 days) and month are also standard units. Money. A unit of measurement that applies to money is called a unit of account. This is normally a currency issued by a country. For instance, the United States use dollars. Each dollar is 100 cents. The United Kingdom uses pounds. Each pound is 100 pennies or pence. Other countries in Europe use the Euro which is 100 cent for the Euro they are not called \"cents\")",
   "Death": "These are just some of the ways in which life forms die. Life forms which have died are normally described as being dead. Human death is very carefully tracked in case of a killing or something (like a disease) that may continue to kill other humans. Death is usually followed by rituals like the funeral, which have been developed by a religion or the state. When people talk about things or events that lead to the death of an organism, those things or events are usually described as being deadly, or fatal. In the case of diseases, \"terminal\" is also used quite often. There are many euphemisms for dying. A few examples are, \"to pass away\", \"to go to a better place\", and \"to kick the bucket.\" In ordinary life, death is when the heart stops beating and the lungs stop breathing for more than several minutes. There are special times in which people recover even though the heart has stopped for 30 minutes, such as near-drowning in very cold water. If machines are used to help the heart and lungs work, then the moment of death is more difficult to know.",
   "Crushing by elephant": "In the past, many rulers in south and southeast Asia had people crushed by elephants. This was common for more than 4000 years. The Romans and Carthaginians also sometimes did this. For hundreds of years, people used elephants for military purposes. Death under the foot of an elephant was common for people who left the army or prisoners as well as for military criminals. The elephant would step upon the head of the condemned, the one commanded to die. Usually, handlers trained the elephant to put its large foot gently on the person's head. At this point, witnesses looked under the elephant's foot to make sure the prisoner was the one who committed the crime. Often, the condemned would scream and beg the witnesses to say it was not him. If a witness stated this was not the criminal, they would probably commit perjury. Perjury means lying at a trial. In those days rulers could punish perjury with death. Few witnesses denied the condemned was the criminal, because then the elephant may crush them instead. Then the mahout, or elephant driver, gave the order, and the elephant would push down with its weight. The skull broke and the foot crushed the head flat. Sometimes, the elephant would drag the condemned through streets before the crushing. Some elephants crushed the arms and legs first, to increase the pain. Most rajahs, Indian rulers, kept elephants for death by crushing. The public could often see the deaths; this was the rulers' warning not to commit a crime. Many of the elephants were very large, weighing more than nine tons. Rulers wanted crushing by elephant to be bloody and gross. Some rulers in history condemned children, too. Many rulers in South Asia used elephants as executioners, ones who put the condemned to death. One nonreligious Mogul Emperor, Akbar (1547-1605), used his favorite elephant as a judge, too. Akbar ruled in the city of Agra from 1570-1585. He believed that his favorite elephant could know who was guilty. He put thousands of people to death this way. Even when the crimes were minor, he sent them to the elephant. Elephant handlers staked them before the great elephant and tried to convince it to step on them. The huge elephant crushed most, but sometimes refused. Akbar believed this proved their innocence and then released them. There are few records about crushing by elephant. Many records were lost. The British wrote many things about it during their long rule of India. The British used crushing by elephant even into the 20th century. They used it to terrify, and because the Indians had used it before them. When the British took over a state, they liked to use local ways of doing things. Different regions crushed people by elephant in different ways. One region put people inside of a bag, so they would not have to watch what was about to happen. Then, the elephant would crush the bag flat with the condemned inside. In another region, people made the condemned watch the elephant slowly come from far away. Its huge feet kept coming closer. Sometimes, they buried the condemned to the neck. The elephant would come and step on the head. Some places made the condemned put his head on a special stand. The stand had fountains on the sides where brains and blood would flow when the elephant pressed down its huge foot. Robert Knox was an English traveler. He wrote about a Sri Lankan crushing in 1681. The last time an elephant executed someone was in Bikaner, India in April, 1947. The executioner was a state elephant named Hawai that weighed over eight tons. Under British rule, it put over 150 thieves and murderers to death with its huge foot.",
   "Fecund universes": "Fecund universes is a multiverse theory of Lee Smolin. It relies on models of our universe and statistics from astrophysics but is more correctly a theory of cosmology. In this theory, collapsing stars, or black holes, are always creating new universes with slightly different laws of physics. Because these laws are only slightly different, each is assumed to be like a mutation of the original universe, as if each universe was a kind of single-celled organism. It would reproduce by \"splitting\" in some sense. This theory relies on many models of our universe to model these \"mutated\" alternative universes, the ones that Smolin supposes are generated or \"spun off\" by black holes. No human can ever be part of any of these \"other\" universes. Observations from astrophysics can only say if the black holes exist or are common, and give some idea of how much the laws of physics can vary and still let the new universes produce new black holes. Smolin predicts that there would be many black holes in the universe humans can see, since they are likely in a very late born universe, by simple probability. If there are many black holes, that is evidence for his theory, As this shows, cosmology has a very different standard of evidence and burden of proof than is required for models of our universe only, which humans (using mathematics) can observe and exchange knowledge on. It is hard to separate science from religion on such questions. It may be a simple matter of preference whether one wants to see one's universe as part of a system like biology or like mechanics - clockwork. Smolin's theory is important mostly because it challenges the mechanistic paradigm. Even if it is wrong, it raises the idea that living beings might have to see their universe as also living to be able to understand or care about it at all. Some compare Smolin's theory to Gaia philosophy which combines biology, geology and ecology to explain the Earth, our planet, as a living thing. If both are right, humans are on a living planet in a living universe. This idea is very appealing - which does not mean it is really \"right\". Some think both are a kind of religion.",
   "Mudguard": "A mudguard is a part of a car, motorcycle or bicycle. People use it to keep mud, water or other objects from coming up onto the vehicle or person.",
   "Seed": "A seed is the part of a plant that the plant makes that can grow into a new plant, by planting near another plant. There are many different kinds of seeds. Some plants make a lot of seeds, some make only a few. Seeds are often hard and very small, but some are larger. The coconut is a seed which can be as big as a child's head. A seed needs water, air and warmth but not sunlight to germinate (become a seedling). Because most kinds of seeds carry the food that helps the new plant begin to grow, many kinds of seeds are good food for animals and people. Seeds are often inside fruits. The many kinds of grain that people grow, such as rice, wheat, and maize, are all seeds. The seed also has a seed coat. The seed coat is an outer covering that protects the seed.",
   "Red": "Red is the color that is on the outside edge of the rainbow. It is one of the three primary colors, along with blue and yellow. Red light has a wavelength between 630-760 nanometers. Red is the color of blood and tomatoes. It is sometimes used to mark things that are wrong, important, or dangerous. Meaning of Red. Red can represent passion, anger, or love. In many countries, a red light shows cars when they should stop. In politics, \"red\" is related to Communism. The \"Red Army\" can refer to the army of the old Soviet Union, or the People's Republic of China. It is also related to the Red Brigade. Red is the color of fire and blood, so it is associated with energy, war, danger, strength, power, determination, as well as passion, desire, and love. Red is an emotionally intense color. It is thought that it tends to raise blood pressure and make people breathe faster. It is very easy to notice, which is why stop signs, stoplights, and fire equipment are usually painted red. In heraldry, red is often used to indicate courage. It is a color found in many national flags. Red brings attention to text and images. It is a perfect color for 'Buy Now' or 'Click Here' buttons on Internet banners and websites, because it may make some people want to act quickly. In advertising, red is often used to cause erotic feelings (red lips, red nails, red-light districts, 'Lady in Red', etc). Red is widely used to indicate danger (high voltage signs, traffic lights). This color is also associated with energy, so it may be used to promote energy drinks, games, cars, items related to sports and high physical activity.",
   "Gas": "A gas is one of the states of matter. Gases are \"fluid\". This means that they can freely move and expand to fill a container. They can be pushed into a smaller volume, or expanded into a greater volume. A gas has a very low density, because the molecules or atoms in the gas are far apart. The volume of a gas mainly depends on two things: temperature and pressure. If the temperature increases and the pressure is constant, the gas's volume will increase. If the pressure increases and the temperature is constant, the gas's volume will decrease. The word \"gas\" can also refer to specific gases, such as natural gas, laughing gas (which is nitrous oxide), or acetylene. It can also be referred to the gas that comes out of the body by the digestive system. This happens when there is an air in the last 7 to 8 inches of the colon. Sometimes people use \"gas\" as a shorter name for gasoline (which is called petrol in some counties), or for the gases used in chemical warfare, like mustard gas.",
   "Hawaiian Islands": "Hawaii has been a state since 1959.",
   "Seville": "Seville (spelled \"Sevilla\" in Spanish) is a big city in the South of Spain, in Europe. There is a big river called the Guadalquivir River which goes through Seville. The city of Seville is the capital of the Spanish region called Andalusia and of the province of Sevilla. The people who live in the city are called \"Sevillanos\" and there are almost a million of them: 700,000. History. A very old story says that the city was started by the famous hero of Greece, named Hercules. The Romans when they came to Spain gave it the Latin name of Hispalis. Over time this changed to be spelled in English as \"Seville\". The Arab Moors took the city when they invaded the country, and you can still see a lot of the buildings they built during their 800 year stay in Spain (711-1492). In the year 1992 Seville was the place for the Expo 92. There is a beautiful bridge across the Guadalquivir River called \"Puente del Alamillo\". It was thought up by Santiago Calatrava a famous building expert. Seville is famous for its hot summer weather. Sports. Seville is the home town of two soccer teams, Sevilla FC (often called simply \"El Sevilla\") and Real Betis Balompi\u00e9 (often called \"El Betis\"). Other websites. Seville is also the name of a place in the State of Ohio.",
   "Hour": "An hour (abbreviation: h or hr) is a unit of measurement used to measure time. An hour is equal to 60 minutes. 24 hours are equal to one day. Unlike the second, the hour is not an SI unit.",
   "Pet": "A pet is a domesticated animal that lives with people, but is not forced to work and is not eaten, in most instances. In most cases, a pet is kept to entertain people or for companionship. Dogs, cats, fish, birds are the most common pets in North America. Horses, elephants, oxen, and donkeys are usually made to work, so they are not usually called pets. Some dogs also do work for people, and it was once common for some birds (like falcons and carrier pigeons) to work for humans. The cap'tchi tribe in Sudan is known for the ritual burning of domesticated animals that are considered too sacred to eat.",
   "Sheffield": "Sheffield is a big city in the region called Yorkshire in the North of England. It is the only town in South Yorkshire officially called a city. Sheffield is in the middle of lots of hills. The city centre is where the River Sheaf meets the River Don. The city is east of the Peak District National Park. The area of Sheffield used to be the Anglo-Saxon shire of Hallamshire, the city itself was founded later. Sheffield is famous for making cutlery (like knives and spoons). People in Sheffield have made cutlery for a very long time (a Sheffield-made knife is referred to in Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\", a book from the middle ages). Sheffield is also famous for making steel. Benjamin Huntsman discovered the crucible technique for making steel in 1740. In 1856, Henry Bessemer invented the Bessemer Converter steelmaking furnace. Henry moved to Sheffield to make steel. Later, in 1912, Harry Brearly invented stainless steel in Sheffield. The first football team in the world was Sheffield F.C., set up in 1857. Sheffield currently has two big professional football teams: Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday. There are lots of famous bands from Sheffield. Some of them are Pulp, the Human League, Def Leppard and the Arctic Monkeys. Michael Palin is also from Sheffield.",
   "Everton F.C.": "Everton Football Club or Everton F.C. are an English football club from the city of Liverpool. The club currently competes in the English Premier League and have played more seasons in the top league of English football than any other team. Everton were founded in 1878. They have a long rivalry with Liverpool FC, whose ground is nearby. When they play each other the match known as a \"Merseyside derby\". In the 1890's Everton played at Anfield, Liverpool's stadium. But the owner of the stadium put the rent up so much the club decided to leave and build their own instead. Everton were then based at a new stadium called Goodison Park. They still play there today. Many famous players have played at Everton including Leon Osman, the English World Cup winning Alan Ball and legendary goal scorer William 'Dixie' Dean. Dean still holds the record for most goals in one season scoring 60 in the 1927/1928 season. History. Everton started out in 1878 with the name St Domingo's FC. At first it was only for people who went to St Domingo's church, but so many people were interested they let people from the local are join as well. A year later the club was renamed Everton Football Club, after the area. Everton Football Club's first ever match was against a team called St Peter's in 1979. Everton won 6-0. Everton entered the FA Cup in the 1886-1887 season. They were beaten 1-0 by Glasgow Rangers in the first round. As football became more and more popular around England, the clubs realised they needed an organised league. In 1888 the Football League was founded. Everton were one of the 12 founding members. Preston North End won the first two leagues and Everton won the third in 1891. They won their second ever trophy, the FA Cup, in 1905 but didn't win another until 1916. It wasn't until 1927 that Everton had their first period of long success. In 1925 they signed Dixie Dean and in 1927 he scored 60 goals in 39 games, setting a new world record and taking Everton to another league title.",
   "Geometry": "Geometry is a kind of mathematics used to work with shapes. Examples of Shapes in Geometry. There are flat shapes and solid shapes in geometry. Squares, circles and triangles are some of the simplest shapes in flat geometry. Cubes, cylinders, cones and spheres are simple shapes in solid geometry. Measuring in Geometry. Geometry can be used to measure the area and perimeter of a flat shape. It can also be used to measure a solid shape's volume and surface area. How is Geometry Used? Many things have the shapes found in geometry. Where Did Geometry Come From? Geometry began as the art of measuring the shape of land so that it could be shared fairly between people. It means to measure the land. It has grown from this to become one of the most important parts of mathematics. The Greek mathematician Euclid wrote the first book about geometry. Some Simple Ideas in Geometry. A point is shown on paper by touching it with a pencil or pen, without making any sideways movement. We know where the point is, but it has no size. A straight line is the shortest distance between two points. For example, Sophie pulls a piece of string from one point to another point. A straight line between the two points will follow the path of the tight string. A plane is flat surface that does not stop in any direction. A ball placed any place on this flat surface will not move if gravity on the surface is constant.",
   "Saxony": "The Free State of Saxony (), is one of 16 states of Germany. It is located in south-east, north of Czech Republic. The biggest city is Leipzig. The capital is called Dresden.",
   "Moscow": "Moscow (Russian language: \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430, Moskva) is the capital city of Russia. 10.5 million people live there, so it is Europe's biggest city. Moscow was founded by Prince Yuri Dolgoruki in 1147. From 1480 until 1703, Moscow was the capital of Russia. It became the capital again from 1918 until 1991. Now it is again the capital of Russia. In the middle of the city is an ancient walled city called the Kremlin. There are important government buildings, museums and churches in the Kremlin. Many of the buildings in Moscow, like St. Basil's Cathedral and Spasskaya Tower, are very beautiful and famous. There are also modern buildings there. There are many art galleries, and the collection of art there is so big that it could take three years to go around.",
   "History of Spain": "Spain is a country located in Europe. Early History. People have lived on the Iberian Peninsula for about 500,000 years. Neanderthal man came about 200,000 years ago. Modern humans first came about 40,000 years The Roman Empire controlled Spain for three hundred years; then people from Northern Europe called the Visigoths fought for Spain and won it from the Romans. They were Christians, and they controlled Spain for two hundred years. A lot of people took over Spain from the 13th century but by the end of the 19th Century Spain was fairly poor,and was ruled by French people. Britain sent its own troops to defend Spain since it was so weak. This put first France, then Britain, in control of Spain for the rest of that century. Today Britain has strong ties to Spain from this time. Roman Catholics from Europe eventually decided to fight to take Spain from the Muslims. They fought wars for many hundreds of years, some of which were Crusades against other Christians like the Cathars. These were very cruel wars. Before this, several different kings had ruled different countries in what is now called Spain. Two of these countries, Castile and Aragon, came together when the king of Aragon, Ferdinand II, married the queen of Castile, Isabella. In the same year, 1492, they decided to send Christopher Columbus to explore the Atlantic Ocean. Columbus found a land there that the people of Europe did not yet know. These were the islands of the Caribbean Sea. Late 15th century. Columbus and other sailors explored more and found that there were two continents there - North America and South America. Spain sent many soldiers and businessmen to North and South America, and they took over very large parts of those two continents. Owning this empire made Spain very rich. But when they conquered that empire, they killed millions of the Native Americans who had lived there before. Spain owned this empire for more than three hundred years. Meanwhile, at home, the Muslim manuscripts had been either burnt or spread to other countries. Jews had been expelled from Spain. The multicultural society was destroyed, and so was the learning. Among the few things kept and respected in Spain were in music: harmony and stringed instruments, and of course the buildings, many of which became churches, by adding crosses. 16th century and 17th century. The Spanish Empire was the strongest in the world through most of the next two centuries, thanks to gold from the Americas. This new gold made rulers and colonial governors rich. Meanwhile others' savings became worth less due to inflation. Spain became a society of very rich and very poor. Some of the poorest went to the new colonies in the Caribbean, Central America and South America, mostly to find gold. Native American peoples were killed by diseases brought by the Spaniards, but most Spaniards did not know this. They found damaged and dying societies with people who had lost some of their most important leaders and thinkers. The Spaniards thought this meant they were inferior, and used this as an excuse to enslave the natives. Millions of natives died mining gold for the Spanish. The Spanish Empire also at this time funded the Spanish Inquisition which tortured and killed anyone who disagreed with the Roman Catholic Church. The Reformation which created Protestant sects in Europe was not allowed into Spain, it was kept out and, as with Jews or Muslims, its believers were killed. The nobles of Spain no longer had to fight anyone since the internal feuds were over. No one could challenge their power. In many ways it was held together as a reign of terror. People who challenged them were often called heretics, so that the Inquisition could torture them, and then nobles take the property. For ordinary people on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, life got worse. A few rulers got rich. Today we would say that these people were guilty of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. Many Church people who had the power to speak out at that time, did so, and they said many of the same things as we would say today. But none of this mattered much to the rulers. The great satire Don Quixote was written about this time. 18th century. In the 18th century, there was doubt over who should become king of Spain; this doubt led many of the kings of Europe to fight to become king of Spain. This was called the War of the Spanish Succession. France occupied Spain for a long time. This made Spain very weak. It also made Spain lose its empire in North and South America; all of the parts of that empire became their own countries, or were taken over by other countries such as the United States of America. 19th century. Spain was poor by the end of this time, and was invaded by Napoleon. Britain sent its own troops to defend Spain since it was so weak. This put first France, then Britain, in control of Spain for the rest of that century. Today Britain has strong ties to Spain from this time. 20th century. There was not much peace in Spain during the first part of the 20th century. Some Spaniards tried to set up a government chosen by the people (a democracy), and they made the King of Spain leave the country. However, in 1936, two different groups of Spaniards went to war over whether the government should be a democracy, or take orders from one person. In 1939, those who wanted democracy were defeated, and a dictator named Francisco Franco took over the government. Franco died in 1975. He had decided that Spain should have a king again, and he chose Juan Carlos, the grandson of the king who had been forced to leave the country, to be king. But the king did not rule as a dictator; instead, he chose to set up a democracy. Now Spain is a modern democratic country, and does business with many countries around the world. It is a part of the European Union.",
   "Value (personal and cultural)": "A value (or principle) usually means an abstract rule, one that can be seen to apply in many experiences, or can be applied by choice in a lot of situations. It can also mean a moral choice one makes often and consistently, for example, a Buddhist avoids eating meat as a matter of principle. Many groups of people agree on lists of principles. They may also try to agree on the order in which they are to apply, that is, which principles should be violated before which other ones. They might also try to list best practices which reflect the principles in the right order, and provide more practical (less abstract) instruction.",
   "Bambuco": "Bambuco is a type of music from Colombia. The beat of this music is like the European waltz or polka. Bambuco is often folk music. There is a dance that goes with Bambuco music. It is a group dance and has a 6/8 or 3/4 meter. Sometimes Bambuco is called \"el bambuco\". People think Bambuco started in Africa. It is popular in the Andean region of Colombia and throughout Latin America.",

   "Of": "Of is a preposition used in the English language to show a possessive relationship. For example, the phrase \"book of maps\" means that the book has maps. The phrase \"father of Mike\" means the father that is being mentioned is Mike's father.",
   "Eurasia": "Eurasia is a continent in the northern part of the Earth. Eurasia is made of Europe and Asia, which are on the same tectonic plate and do not have a sea between them, so they are scientifically one continent. The word is made by adding \"Eur\" (from \"Eur\"ope) to \"Asia\" to make \"Eurasia\". Some geographers say it's all just one continent, because unlike the Americas or Africa, Europe and Asia are not divided by sea. The Ancient Greeks divided the world they knew into Europe, Asia and Africa. Since then, people have been talking about Asia and Europe as two continents so it is now a tradition. Some other continents are not completely divided by sea and are joined together and by a thin strip of land (called an isthmus) like North America and South America. However, Europe and Asia are not divided by sea at all. Sometimes Eurasia is divided into West Eurasia and East Eurasia. West Eurasia is Europe and the Middle East. Historians sometimes add North Africa to West Eurasia because the Sahara Desert divides North Africa from the other parts of Africa and it is as difficult to cross as a sea.",
   "Evidence": "Evidence is something that is used to support an argument. It gives examples of why something is true. For example, if someone come across a cup of spilled milk, that person could look for evidence as to how the milk was spilled. If hairs of a cat and paw prints were found on the ground, they could be evidence that suggested that a cat was the cause of the spilled milk.",
   "Topology": "Topology is the study of how spaces are organized, how the objects are structured in terms of position. It also studies how spaces are connected. It is divided into \"algebraic topology\", \"differential topology\" and \"geometric topology\". Topology has sometimes been called rubber-sheet geometry, because in topology there is no difference between a circle and a square (a circle made out of a rubber band can be stretched into a square) but there is a difference between a circle and a figure eight (you cannot stretch a figure eight into a circle without tearing). The spaces studied in topology are called topological spaces. They vary from familiar manifolds to some very exotic constructions. Natural Origin. In many problems to solve, we often divide a large space into smaller areas, for instance, a house is divided into rooms, a nation into states, a type of quantity into numbers, etc. Each of these smaller areas (house, state, number) is adjacent to other small areas (other houses/states/numbers), the adjacencies between these spaces are connections. If we write down on paper a list of spaces, and the connections between them, we have written down a description of a space -- a topological space. All topological spaces have the same properties (adjacencies, etc.) and are made of the same structure (a list of smaller areas). Because of this, general algorithms and other forms of analysis are made possible. For instance, to program a robot to navigate a house, we simply give it a list of rooms, the connections between each room (doors, etc.), and an algorithm that can determine the sequence of rooms to travel through to reach any other desired room. We can go further by creating subdivisions of subdivisions of space. For instance, a nation divided into states, divided into counties, divided into city boundaries, etc. All this kind of information can be represented topologically.",
   "Vacation": "A vacation is some time, usually between a week and a month, when people do not have to go to work, but get paid. This allows them to travel out of town or do other things they wouldn't otherwise have time for. (It is comparable to holiday.)",
   "Nature": "The word nature is used for all the things that aren't made by humans. Things like people, animals, mountains, rivers, trees, rain, and the sun are part of nature. Things that are part of nature are called natural. Scientists study the way the parts of nature work. Many people enjoy looking at natural things or walking in natural places, but people also have to think about how they want to use nature. Or, how they can be useful to it. Some people see reforesting and wild gardening as ways to be useful to nature. This means they must know how it works, and how it affects the air, soil, water, plants, animals and their own body. The science of ecology is about their connection, while biology studies the parts. These are two of the Natural Sciences. They create models of nature. \"The science is covered in that article.\" In many ways humans and nature can be said to be in conflict. Nature is often seen by humans as natural resources. People cut down trees to get wood to burn or to build houses, or to make a place to grow food. Fires, cars, and factories make a lot of smoke, especially in cities. When people catch a lot of fish, sometimes they kill all the fish or harm the spawning grounds and there are none left. For instance the trawling method of catching fish very often damages coral that the small fish need to hide from big ones. People who like to leave nature unharmed and those who feel they need to use more of nature often fight about what they should do. In the modern world, with many people and many big cities, these problems are becoming more serious. It takes politics to sort them out fully. Some types of political parties focus on the idea of natural law, which is that nature shows humans how to do things, and that humans must study nature to sort out all problems. This is a very old idea, and is part of many ethical traditions. Some people think that humans do not need nature at all, and can replace everything that it does.",
   "Dental pulp": "The dental pulp is the part in the center of a tooth. It is made up of living soft tissue and cells. It is surrounded by dentine and contains nerves and blood vessels.",
   "Volume": "The volume of an object describes how much physical space it takes up using the three dimensions of width, depth, and height. Use. The term volume can be used to describe real things like boxes, lakes, and buildings. All of these things have width, depth, and height. The formula for measuring volume is width\u00d7depth\u00d7height.",
   "Oxymoron": "An oxymoron is made up of two or more words that seem to be opposite to each other, or actually are opposite. For example, the words \"Wise fool\", \"Warm freezer\", \"Legal murder\" all have two words. In each one, the one word looks like the opposite of the other word. You can have words that look opposite, but are right. For example, a \"warm freezer\" could be right. A freezer could be warm if it was turned off or left open. Words that really are opposite to each other, would be words that just cannot be put together. For example, a \"round square\" could not happen because squares are not round. Oxymorons sometimes appear in jokes. Sometimes, the joke is just to say that a pair of words are an oxymoron. For example, a joke that says that \"honest politician\" is an oxymoron. This means that politicians are dishonest, if the word 'politician' is opposite to 'honest'.",

   "International System of Units": "The International System of Units is the international standard form of the metric system today. SI is the short name for this from the French language phrase \"Syst\u00e8me International d'unit\u00e9s\". The metric system is a system of measuring based on the metre for length, distance or displacement, kilogram for mass, and second for time. The metre, kilogram and second can be used in combination with each other. This will make different units of measurement to mean other amounts, such as volume, energy, pressure, and velocity. Sometimes we want to talk about larger or smaller measurements. Then we add a prefix. A prefix is something to the beginning of a word to make a word. The prefix \"kilo-\" means \"1000\" and the prefix \"milli-\" means \"0.001\". So one \"kilometre\" is 1000 metres and one \"milligram\" is a 1000th of a gram. These prefixes are shown in the table on the right side. History and use. These were created in France after the French Revolution. They are now used almost everywhere in the world, apart from the United States, Liberia and Myanmar, where the older imperial units are still widely employed. Varios other countries, most of them historically related to the British Empire, are in different stages of the process of introduction of the metric system as replacement for or as an addition to the use of the imperial system. Even the United Kingdom, which created the old US units of measurement, is now generally using the metric system alongside the imperial system. There is even pressure to become more metric, both as a result of UK government plans dating before Britain's entry into the European Union and because of EU rules regarding common systems of measurement. Base units of measurement. The SI base units are measurements used by scientists and other people around the world. All the other units can be written by combining these seven base units in different ways. These other units are called \"derived units\". Length (\"l\"). Unit: metre or meter (m) One metre is defined as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458\u00a0second. This standard was adopted in 1983 when the speed of light in vacuum was defined to be precisely 299,792,458\u00a0m/s. Mass (\"m\"). One kilogram is defined to be the mass of a specific cylinder of platinum-iridium alloy. It is kept at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. There is an ongoing effort to introduce a definition using other basic or atomic constants. Time (\"t\"). One second is defined as the time required for 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation between to two specific energy levels of the element caesium-133. This definition was adopted in 1967. Electric flow (\"I\"). The ampere is that constant electrical current (or flow) which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed one metre apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-7 newton per metre of length. The ampere is one of two base units (the other being the candela) that uses derived units in its definition, not just base units. One newton is 1\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u00a0s-2. Temperature (\"T\"). The kelvin, unit of temperature, is the fraction 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water. It is named after Lord Kelvin. Amount of substance (\"n\"). Unit: mole (mol) Luminous intensity (brightness of light) (\"I\"). The candela is the luminous intensity (brightness), in a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency 540\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01012\u00a0hertz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1/683\u00a0watt\u00a0per\u00a0steradian. The candela is one of two base units (the other being the ampere) that uses derived units in its definition, not just base units. One hertz is 1\u00a0s-1, one watt is 1\u00a0J\u00a0s-1\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0kg\u00a0m2\u00a0s-2 and the steradian is the solid angle subtended at the centre of a sphere of radius \"r\" by a portion of the surface of the sphere having an area \"r\"2. Derived units with special names. There are also derived units which have special names. Usually these were made to make calculating simpler.",
   "Madrid": "Madrid is the capital and largest city of Spain and is home to five million people. The capital used to be Valladolid until 1560. Madrid is in the middle of Spain, in the Community of Madrid. There are 3.1 millon people living in Madrid. Spain's Royal Palace is in Madrid. It is one of the largest palace in all of Western Europe. But the king and his family do not live there anymore; they live in a smaller palace, and only use the Royal Palace for important events, like meeting other kings and presidents. One can go inside the Royal Palace, see the many beautiful paintings and expensive furniture and jewelry, and learn about the past kings and queens of Spain. There are also a lot of very big and important art museums in Madrid, like the Prado Museum, the Queen Sofia Museum, and the Thyssen-Bornemisza museum. These show off paintings, sculptures, and other works of art from some of the most famous artists in the world. Many famous, important, and valuable works of art are in these museums. For example, the Queen Sofia museum has a famous painting by Pablo Picasso, called \"Guernica\". Picasso painted this painting to show how sad and angry it made him when the German Nazis destroyed a town in Spain called Guernica in 1937. Picasso had said that the painting should never return to Spain until it was a democracy again. Once that happened, they built the Queen Sofia museum just to have a good place to put it. There are many other sites to see in Madrid. Many people go to see the Plaza Mayor which was a market place. The Plaza de la Villa was another famous market place. There are a lot of shops along the Gran Via. Real Madrid football fans celebrate at the Plaza de Cibeles. Two famous gates to see are the Puerta del Sol and the Puerta de Alcal\u00e1. Madrid has some lovely parks. The Retiro Park is the most famous. The Cristal Palace can be found in this park. The Plaza de Toros is visited by many tourists. Many madrile\u00f1os enjoy bullfights there. One of the most recent sites built in Madrid are the KIO Towers. These are also known as the Gateway to Europe.",
   "Krishna": "Krishna was the Eight Avatara of Vishnu in Hinduism. He is also a Manifestation of God in the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith. Krishna's birth. King Kansa was ruling over Dwarka, in [Gujarat], India). His sister Devaki was married to Vasudev. Kansa was very cruel and made his people miserable. At the time of Devaki and Vasudev's marriage, a voice came from sky that their eighth son would kill Kansa. Hearing this, Kansa imprisoned the couple at Mathura and started killing their sons one by one. When the eighth son was born, a miracle happened. The prison doors opened by themselves. Krishna was born in a prison cell. Vasudeva took the infant outside. It was raining heavily but he managed to take him to a place called Vrundawan. He came back to prison with a newly born girl, the daughter of the king of Vrundavan. Kansa tried to kill the girl but she slipped from his hand and rose into the sky. This way Krishna was saved.Many devoted him afterwards also. The Meera bhai was Also one of the devoted one",
   "London": "London is the capital of England and the United Kingdom, and also the largest city of United Kingdom. It is in the South-East of England, on the River Thames. It is also known as \"Lunnainn\" in Scottish, \"Llundain\" in Welsh and \"Londain\" in Irish. In history, London is only the area of the City of London, but now people say London more generally to mean the whole city of Greater London. People started living in the city 2,000 years ago, and today about 7.5 million people live there. This means it is the city with the most number of people in Europe. People in London come from many different countries, and speak more than 300 different languages. There are also many religions and cultures. London is an important place for business, finance, and culture. It also has a big influence on world politics, entertainment, media, fashion, and art. It has many famous museums, churches, and popular places for tourists to visit. History. The Romans built a city called \"Londinium\" on the River Thames in AD 43. The name \"Londinium\" (and then 'London') came from the Celtic language of the Ancient Britons. In the year 61 AD, Queen Boudica (a British Celtic queen) and her army destroyed the city. Boudica killed herself when Romans trapped her and the Romans then rebuilt London. London became an important trading city. After the Romans left Britain, no-one lived in the city for a long time because the Anglo-Saxons liked living in the countryside. In the 9th century, people started living there again. It became the largest city in England, but it did not become the capital city of England until the 12th century. After the railways were built, London grew very big. Greater London has 33 London Boroughs and a mayor. The old City of London is only a square-mile in size but has its own Lord Mayor. Another famous old part of Greater London is Westminster, which was always a different city from the City of London. Westminster has Westminster Abbey (a cathedral), The Palace of Westminster (the Houses of Parliament, with Big Ben), and 10 Downing Street (where the Prime Minister lives). Twinnings. London also has a \"partnership\" agreement with Tokyo, Japan.",
   "Dental floss": "Dental floss is a thread. It is used for cleaning spaces between teeth which cannot be reached by toothbrushes. It is important to floss before brushing teeth and to floss at least once a day. Tooth brushing will not clean food that is packed between teeth. This 'food packing' can lead to unhealthy teeth and gums. Bacteria grow in this 'packed food' between teeth. This bacteria causes the surface of teeth (enamel) to break down. When a person first starts flossing, bleeding can happen. This is normal and happens because teeth and gums that are not flossed are less healthy. It will stop as the teeth and gums get healthier with flossing.",
   "Metaphor": "Metaphor is language we use to compare things, but without using \"like\" or \"as\" - because that would be a simile. Another sort of metaphor is a \"conceptual metaphor\". A metaphor very often uses the verb \"to be\": \"love \"is\" war\", for example, not that a writer sees \"love \"is like\" war\" (this is a simile). Poetry includes much metaphor, usually more than prose. Idioms use metaphors, or are metaphors: for example, the English phrase \"to kick the bucket\" means \"to die\". Spam is an example that any email user knows about - this word was originally a metaphor, from \"spam\", a tinned meat people do not usually like. Servers putting unwanted email into somebody's inbox was similar to waiters putting unwanted spam into food. This was originally suggested by a Monty Python skit (funny scene). When we use a metaphor very often and we forget the old meaning, or forget that the two meanings are connected, this is a \"dead metaphor\". Originally \"metaphor\" was a Greek word for \"transfer\". It came from \"meta\" (\"change\") and \"pherein\" (\"carry\"). So the word \"metaphor\" in English was a metaphor, too. Today in Greek, \"metaphor\" is a trolley (a thing that is pushed for carrying shopping or bags).",
   "Language": "but human language is the key meaning of \"language.\" Some people discuss \"animal languages,\" but others do not agree and say that \"animal languages\" are not clear or meaningful enough to be 'true' languages. It depends on the definition of \"language.\" \"Language\" could also mean a form of subject in school. Mathematics and computer science use made-up languages called formal languages (like computer programming languages), but these may or may not be 'true' languages. Mathematics itself is considered a language by many. A person who is able to speak, use and understand words from more than one tongue (language) is said to be multilingual. Gestures (communication through hand movements) are one way people can try to make themselves understood when they cannot speak in the same language. There is also sign language, which is used to speak to people who cannot hear. Chinese is the language with the most speakers in the world. English is often called \"the international language\" because it is the main language of many things, such as science, business, and entertainment. There is only one language which is officially known as \"La Internacia Lingvo\" - The Inter-national Language - and that language is Esperanto.",
   "Coordinated Universal Time": "Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the standard time zone of the world. The standard before was Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). UTC and GMT are almost the same. It is also called civil time and Zulu time. Some websites, like Wikipedia, use UTC because it does not make any country look more important than the others. It offers one time for all the internet (the same time can be used by people all over the world). Timezones are often named by how many hours they are different from UTC time. For example, UTC -5 (United States east coast) is 5 hours behind UTC. If the time is 07:00 UTC, the local time is 02:00 in New York (UTC -5) and 10:00 in Moscow (UTC +3) When this page loaded, it was, in UTC",
   "Norway": "Norway is a country in the north of Europe. It is a part of the Scandinavian peninsula. The mainland of Norway is surrounded by a coast and borders with Russia, Finland,and Sweden. The coast touches the Oslo Fjord, Skagerrak, and the North Sea. The Kingdom of Norway has been independent since 1905. Its head of state is now King Harald V. The national day is May 17, which celebrates Norway's constitution of 1814. The parliament is called \"Stortinget\" and its members are elected by the people every 4 years. About 4.6 million people live in Norway. The capital, is the city of Oslo. It is also the largest city, with a population of over 530,000. Other major cities are Bergen with 230,000 people and Trondheim with 150,000; both have been the Norwegian capital in earlier years. Norwegian is the national language. There are two official written versions of Norwegian called \"bokm\u00e5l\" and \"nynorsk\". Many Sami individuals, are native speakers, of one of the Sami languages. (\"Nord-samisk\" is also an official language in a number of \"kommuner\". (Each \"kommune\" has a mayor.) History. King Harald is the first king born in Norway in over 600 years. He has two children; Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise and Crown Prince Haakon Magnus. In World War I Norway was neutral and served as a trading nation. Norway tried to stay neutral in World War II, but was occupied by German forces from 9 April 1940 to 8 May 1945. Even though it is a country it is special Ministry of Defence. The Government has Norwegian soldiers working in Afghanistan, together with soldiers from other countries that belong to Nato. Economy. oil, hydroelectric power, and fish. Other natural resources are agriculture, forests, and minerals. The Government collects much money from various sources, and has policies intended to spread this wealth among Norwegians. This spread of wealth, is done both directly and indirectly. Ethnicity. A native population of Norway, the Sami people, previously lived mainly in the northern parts of the country. Many Sami individuals, now, do not live in areas that are considered to be Sami. Tourism. Among tourists to Norway, more come from Germany than from any other country. The Norwegian and German languages are related. Media. The largest newspapers in Norway are BT Bergens Tidende, VG Verdens Gang, Aftenposten and Dagbladet. Norway has no national newspaper. The 3 last newspapers are Oslo-based. Famous people born in Norway. See: Norwegian people Languages. Not all Sami individuals, can speak any of the Sami languages.",
   "Imagination": "Imagination has to be primarily with the mind. It is the ability to form mental images of things or events. When someone \"imagines\" something he or she is trying to picture something in his/her mind that he/she has not experienced him/herself in reality. The word Imaginary is also used to describe something that you have Imagined in your Imagination. This is a very common word in English.",
   "Queen": "A queen is the female head of a royal family. Sometimes she is the wife of a king, but sometimes the queen is the ruler and her husband is not a king. In a country whose system of government is a monarchy, the ruler, or head of state, is decided by inheritance. That is, when a ruler dies their child, or nearest relative, takes over. For much of history most countries were governed in this way, especially in Europe. Some countries elect their monarch instead of using inheritance, like the Holy Roman Empire and Malaysia. If the ruler is male they are called a king. If female they are called a queen. The wife of a king is also called a queen. However the husband of a female ruler is not called a king. The last King of Britain (George VI) had a wife (Elizabeth) who was called Queen Elizabeth. When he died he had no sons, so he was followed by his daughter. She was also called Elizabeth and became Queen Elizabeth II. She was married to The Duke of Edinburgh; but when she became Queen he did not become King. Many people do not think it is good to have a Queen, because she is not elected, though most people in the UK want to keep the royal family.",

The new name of Arels and Oxford together is CELS. There are three levels in the CELS exam. \"Preliminary\" is the easiest exam. \"Vantage\" is more difficult. \"Higher\" is the most difficult exam. People who have the CELS are very good at speaking English. These exams are good for universities. This exam is different from some other exams because learners get one certificate (paper saying how good they are) for each part of the exam. A learner can have a high mark on the speaking certificate but a low one in writing, for example. Compare exams. It is very difficult to compare English exams. Every exam is a little different. In Europe, the ALTE says how different exams compare. The ALTE is the Association of Language Testers in Europe. It has 28 exam makers in it, and compares their exams in 24 languages. The ALTE says what learners can do at every step of learning. Because of this, they say the ALTE list is a \"can-do\" list. The ALTE list is a simple way to talk about the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEF). The CEF is from the Council of Europe.",

   "Terrorism": "Terrorism is the act of scaring people for a social or political reason using violence (or threat of violence). A person who uses terrorism is called a terrorist. Terrorists think that if civilians are afraid of them, they will have more power over other people. But a boy who hits his sister only for attention is not a terrorist (although it may hurt very badly). Terrorists may also be trying to make their enemies attack the people whom the terrorists claim to represent. The terrorists do this because they think that the people who have been attacked will help them. For example, terrorism has been endemic to Israel for a long time. There, Palestinian Hamas terrorists killed Israeli civilians in bomb attacks, provoking Israel into carrying out revenge attacks against Palestinian civilians, thus increasing Palestinian hate for Israel and support for Hamas. An example of a well-known terrorist is Osama bin Laden, the founder of al-Qaeda and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Although some people first picture terrorists as Muslims or religious groups, but this is not necessarily correct. An example of a non-religious sepratist-terrorist group would be Euskadi Ta Askatasuna also known as the ETA. According to the National Counterterrorism Center, terrorists killed 20,498 people in 2006. By comparison, the World Health Organization estimates that 2 million people die each year from tuberculosis. The major effects of terrorism comes from the fear it generates. Terrorist operations are usually financed by other criminal programs, such as identity theft.",
   "Century": "A century is a way to describe a length of time. One century is one hundred years. The ancient Romans used the word century to describe a group of about one hundred soldiers, organized into a single unit. The Roman numeral for 100 is \"C\". The word for 100 in Latin is \"centum\". Centuries in the Gregorian Calendar (the most-commonly used calendar with 365 days) begin at one instead of zero. That means that in the year 2004, we were in the 21st century, rather than 20th century.",
   "October": "October is the tenth month of the year and it has 31 days. The name comes from the Latin \"oct\" for \"eight\" (it was the eighth month of the year, before July and August were added by the Roman Emperors Augustus and Julius Caesar). October begins on the same day of week as previous January, except in leap years. October's flower is the Calendula with its birthstone being the Opal. The meaning of the Opal is Hope.",
   "Black pudding": "Black pudding is an English name for blood sausage. It is food made by cooking down the blood of any mammal (usually pigs or cattle) with meat, fat or filler until it is thick enough to congeal (become firm or solid) when cooled. Types of Black pudding. In England blood sausage is called \"Black Pudding\". The ingredients include pig's blood, suet, bread, barley and oatmeal. The most common kind of German \"blutwurst\" is made from fatty pork meat, beef blood and filler such as barley. Though already cooked and \"ready to eat\" it is usually served warm. Other kinds of blood sausage include \"boudin noir\" (France), \"boudin rouge\" (Creole and Cajun) and \"morcilla\" (Spain). History. A legend says that blood sausage was invented in a bet between two Bavarian butchers drunk on the alcoholic drink absinthe during the 14th century. Homer's \"Odyssey\" from Ancient Greece says that \"As when a man besides a great fire has filled a sausage with fat and blood and turns it this way and that and is very eager to get it quickly roasted...\".",

   "Saint Lawrence River": "The Saint Lawrence River is a big river in eastern North America. It flows between the Canadian province of Ontario and the American state of New York, and through the Canadian province of Quebec. The river drains water from the Great Lakes into the Atlantic Ocean. It is more than three thousand kilometres long. The river meets the Atlantic Ocean in a big \"estuary\" or bay, the biggest in the world; this is called the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. The Canadian cities of Kingston, Montreal, and Quebec City are on this river. It is very important because ships can sail up the river and through the Great Lakes right into the middle of North America. It is the third largest river in Canada.",
   "Test tube": "A test tube is a kind of laboratory glassware, composed of a fingerlike length of glass tubing, open at the top, usually with a rounded lip at the top, and a rounded 'U' shaped bottom. They range in size from a couple inches to several inches long, from a few millimeters to a couple centimeters in diameter. They are designed to allow easy heating of samples, to be held in a flame, and often are made of expansion-resistant glasses, such as borosilicate glass (known by brand-names such as Pyrex and Kimax). Tests tubes are often preferred above beakers when multiple small chemical or biological samples have to be handled and/or stored. Vacutainers are a type of test tube that can be used for both collection and storage of blood.",
   "Like": "As works in the same way as example 2 - comparing two things using either the word \"like\" or the word \"as\" is called making a simile (\"As big as an elephant\"). It may be better to use the word \"as\" for this to stop confusion with example 1.",
   "Meaning of life": "Many religions, ways of thinking, and creative artists have tried to figure out the Meaning of Life. Some people say that we will never know what the meaning of life is. Many religions claim to offer some answers. There are also ways of thinking called philosophies which claim to offer some answers. There are also artists who paint pictures to explain the meaning of life. As well, there are musicians who write and play music and songs, and writers who write novels and stories to explain the meaning of life. Many people from different religions or cultures have different opinions on what the meaning of life is. We may never find out who is right. Some people, called existentialists believe there is no meaning of life, except the meaning that we make up for ourselves.",
   "Physics": "Physics is the science of matter and how matter interacts. What is physics? Physics is the study of matter and energy in space and time and how they are related to each other. Physicists assume (take as given) the existence of mass, length, time, electric charge and temperature and then define (give the meaning of) all other physical quantities in terms of these basic units. Mass, length, time, electric charge and temperature are never defined but the standard units used to measure them are always defined. In the International System of Units, the meter is the basic unit of length, the kilogram is the basic unit of mass, the second is the basic unit of time, the coulomb is the basic unit of electric charge. Temperature may be expressed in degree Celsius, degree Fahrenheit, or in degree Kelvin. The International System of Units (abbreviated SI from the French Syst\u00e8me International) is the world's most widely used system, both in everyday commerce and in science but the United States has not adopted it yet. Physics studies how things move, and the forces that make them move. For example, velocity and acceleration are used by physics to show how things move. Also, physicists study the forces of gravity, electricity, magnetism and the forces that hold matter together. Physics studies very large things, and very small things. For example, physics studies stars, planets and galaxies and other big pieces of matter. Physics also studies small pieces of matter, such as atoms and electrons. Physics also studies sound, light and other waves. Physics studies energy, heat and radioactivity, and even space and time. Physics not only helps people understand how objects move, but how they change form, how they make noise, how hot or cold they will be, and what they are made of at the smallest level. Physics uses numbers. Physics is a quantitative science because it is based on numerical measurements. Mathematics is used in physics to make models and predictions of how nature behaves. The predictions are compared to the way the real world works. Physicists are always working to make their models of the world better. General description. Physics is the science of matter and how matter interacts. Physics is used to describe the physical universe around us, and to predict how it will behave. Physics is the science concerned with the discovery and characterization of the universal laws which govern matter, movement and forces, and space and time, and other features of the natural world. Breadth and goals of physics. The sweep of physics is broad, from the tiniest components of matter and the forces that hold it together, to galaxies and even larger structures. There are only four forces that appear to operate over this entire range. However, even these four forces (gravity, electromagnetism, the weak force associated with radioactivity, and the strong force which holds atoms together) are believed to be different aspects of a single force. Physics is primarily focused on the goal of formulating ever simpler, more general, and more accurate rules that govern the character and behavior of matter and space itself. One of the major goals of physics is the formulation of theories of universal applicability. Therefore, physics can be viewed as the study of those universal laws which define, at the most fundamental level possible, the behavior of the physical universe. Physics uses the scientific method. Physics uses the scientific method. That is, data from experiments and observations are collected. Theories which attempt to explain these data are produced. Physics uses these theories to not only describe physical phenomena, but to model physical systems and predict how these physical systems will behave. Physicists then compare these predictions to observations or experimental evidence to show whether the theory is right or wrong. The theories that are well supported by data and are especially simple and general are sometimes called scientific laws. Of course, all theories, including those known as laws, can be replaced by more accurate and more general laws, when a disagreement with data is found. Physics is Quantitative. Physics is more quantitative than most other sciences. That is, many of the observations in physics may be represented in the form of numerical measurements. Most of the theories in physics use mathematics to express their principles. Most of the predictions from these theories are numerical. This is because of the areas which physics has addressed are more amenable to quantitative approaches than other areas. Sciences also tend to become more quantitative with time as they become more highly developed, and physics is one of the older sciences. Fields of physics. Classical physics traditionally included the fields of mechanics, optics, electricity, magnetism, acoustics and thermodynamics. Modern physics is a term normally used to cover fields which rely on quantum theory, including quantum mechanics, atomic physics, nuclear physics, particle physics and condensed matter physics, as well as the more modern fields of general and special relativity. Although this distinction can be commonly found in older writings, it is of limited current significance as quantum effects are now understood to be of importance even in fields previously considered purely classical. Approaches in physics. There are many approaches to studying physics, and many different kinds of actitivies in physics. There are two main types of activities in physics; the collection of data and the development of theories. The data in some subfields of physics is amenable to experiment. For example, condensed matter physics and nuclear physics benefit from the ability to perform experiments. Experimental physics focuses mainly on an empirical approach. Sometimes experiments are done to explore nature, and in other cases experiments are performed to produce data to compare with the predictions of theories. Some other fields in physics like astrophysics and geophysics are primarily observational sciences because most their data has to be collected passively instead of through experimentation. Nevertheless, observational programs in these fields uses many of the same tools and technology that are used in the experimental subfields of physics. Theoretical physics often uses quantitative approaches to develop the theories that attempt to explain the data. In this way, theoretical physics often relies heavily on tools from mathematics. Theoretical physics often can involve creating quantitative predictions of physical theories, and comparing these predictions quantitatively with data. Theoretical physics sometimes creates models of physical systems before data is available to test and validate these models. These two main activities in physics, data collection and theory production and testing, draw on many different skills. This has led to a lot of specialization in physics, and the introduction, development and use of tools from other fields. For example, theoretical physicists apply mathematics and numerical analysis and statistics and probability and computers and computer software in their work. Experimental physicists develop instruments and techniques for collecting data, drawing on engineering and computer technology and many other fields of technology. Often the tools from these other areas are not quite appropriate for the needs of physics, and need to be adapted or more advanced versions have to be produced. Physicists. There are many famous physicists. Isaac Newton studied gravity. Galileo Galilei studied light and how planets move. Albert Einstein made a theory for how light can make electrons move, and studied how gravity affects light and space. Heinrich Hertz discovered that light is a type of electromagnetic wave. Ernest Rutherford said that \"Physics is the only real science. The rest are just stamp collecting.\"",
   "Beard": "A beard is the hair growing on the lower part of a man's face. The hair that grows on the upper lip of some men is a mustache. When a man has hair only below the lower lip and above the chin, it is called a soul patch. Some men have a lot of hair and a big beard, and some have very little. In the modern world, many men shave part or all of their beards, or cut their beard so it does not get very long. Some animals also have hair like this, and people sometimes also call this hair a beard.",
   "China": "China (\u4e2d\u570b) is an ancient region in Asia. History. China has one of the oldest civilizations in the world. It has a recorded history for over five thousand years. It reached its golden age during the Tang Dynasty (about A.D. 10th century). China is home to some of the oldest artwork in the world. Statues and pottery, as well as decorations made of jade, are some classic examples. China's economic and military strength throughout the world was oppressed during the Qing Dynasty (around the 17th century to 20th century). Many of its lands were lost to Russia, the British, the Japanese and other strong countries. In 1911 a country, the Republic of China was founded by Sun Yat-sen (Sun Yixian). But its government was very weak. Army leaders in different area controlled the local governments, and later fell into the dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek (Jiang Jieshi). In 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria, a place in the northeastern part of China. On July 7, 1937, the Japanese attacked the rest of the country, starting what was named the Sino-Japanese War. The war later became part of World War II. The war was fought for eight years and millions of Chinese people were killed. In 1945, after the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan surrendered unconditionally to the Allied Powers. However, the Chinese Civil War later started between the Kuomindang (Nationalists) of the Republic of China (ROC) and the Communists of the People's Republic of China (PRC).One side wanted to make China like Soviet Union, whreas the other side wanted to keep china in its current state at the time, which caused chaos and lots of people died in the Chinese Civil War. the Chinese Civil War was going on throughout World War II. The Communists, led by Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi and others. Later Shaoqi lost influence on Mao and his death to this day remains unresolved. Communists eventually won the war. The Nationalists (led by Chiang Kai-shek) fled to the island of Taiwan and set up their new capital city in Taipei.After the Chinese Civil War, the communist leader Mao Zedong declared a new country, the People's Republic of China (PRC), in Beijing on October 1, 1949. Arts. China is the original birth place of Eastern martial arts, called Kung Fu or its first name Wushu. China is also the home of the well-respected Spa Monastery and Wudang Mountains. The first generation of martial art started more for the purpose of survival and warfare than art. Over time some art forms have branched off, while others have retained their distinct Chinese flavor. Regardless, China has brewed some of the most renowned artists including Wong Fei Hung (Huang Fei Hung or Hwang Fei Hung) and many others. Art has also co-existed with a variety of paints including the more standard 18 colors. Legendary and controversial moves like Big Mak are also praised and talked about within the culture.",

   "Flea": "The flea (\"siphonaptera\") is an insect that lives on many kinds of animals and sometimes humans. Fleas are considered parasites, and they drink the blood of the animal they bite. Fleas can live outdoors in sand or tall grass, and they will jump to any passing animal and lay eggs. Flea bites are usually red bumps and they itch. They can carry disease and make animals sick. There are several types of fleas including the dog flea, cat flea, human flea, northern rat flea, and the oriental rat flea. During the Middle Ages, the oriental rat flea that spread a virus that caused the Bubonic Plague, also known as the Black Death or Black Plague, a huge epidemic the size of today's bird flu. The oriental rat flea would become infected by this virus. After infected the bacteria grew inside of the flea eventually blocking the path to their stomach. Because of this the flea was always hungry. When the flea would bite a human it opened up the skin and since the stomach of the flea was blocked, the blood from the human was heaved up back into the human, but only this time it was infected with the Bubonic virus.",
   "Green": "Green is a color. It is one of the colors of the rainbow. Green is between the yellow and blue colors in a rainbow. Green paint can be made by mixing yellow paint and blue paint together. Green light, like all light, is formed from waves. In its wave, the distance between the smallest repeating parts (the wavelength) is about 550 nanometers (one-billionth of a meter). Most leaves of growing plants, such as trees and bushes, are green. This is because there is a chemical in leaves, called chlorophyll, which is green. Meaning of Green. Green is seen as the color of nature. It is a symbol of growth, harmony, freshness, and fertility. Dark green is also associated with money in the United States (American dollars are called \"greenbacks). Green is also seen as be able to stay the same and endurance. Sometimes green can stand for \"no experience\". For example, a 'greenhorn' is a beginner. In heraldry, green stands for growth and hope. Green also stands for safety. It is the color for \"GO\" on traffic lights. Because green is seen as the color of nature, it is often used with environment-friendly products. A person who is said to have a \"green thumb\" is good at growing plants. \"Dark green\" is associated with ambition, greed, and jealousy. A very pale \"Yellow-green\" can mean sickness, being scared, discord, and jealousy. However, a bright \"chartreuse green\" can mean health and healing. \"Aqua\" is associated with making someone feel better and protection, as well as being associated with good health from getting exercise by going swimming. \"Olive green\" is the traditional color of peace.",

It is arguably Kipling's most famous poem.",
   "Hobby": "A hobby is an leisure activity that people do for fun or recreation. People do it because they like it. Arts and crafts. Some people do arts and crafts. They make clothing or decorations with their hands. Some popular arts and crafts that involve textiles or fabrics include crocheting, sewing (making clothing), embroidery (e.g.,cross stitch, needlepoint, crewel and satin stitch, etc.), knitting, and quilting. Some people like to hobbies that involve making images on paper, such as scrapbooking, painting, and drawing.

Some people enjoy learning how to repair motor vehicles, such as antique cars, motorcycles, or pickup trucks. Some people even build and repair sailboats in their backyard. Many people have hobbies that they do in the kitchen, such as cooking, making meals for their guests and family, and making their own beer. Many people also have hobbies in their home that involve animals, such as keeping a pet animal, such as a dog, a cat, or a turtle. Some people even learn about dog breeding. Collecting. Collecting is a popular hobby in North America and in Europe. People enjoy finding interesting examples of different items and learning about them. Some of the well-known types of collecting include stamp collecting, coin collecting, trading cards such as baseball cards, and autographs of celebrities (famous people). People also collect toys, books, comic books, and old records. Some people collect antiques and artwork, but these hobbies are more rare, because antiques and artwork are usually expensive. A type of hobby that is related to collecting is model-building. People who do model-building as a hobby collect small models which they build, paint, and then display. Some common types of model-building hobbies include model airplanes, model rockets, model ships, model cars, and model railways. Outdoor activities and sports. Outdoor hobbies include birdfeeding, birdwatching, canoeing, gardening, hiking, walking, and sports such as baseball, bowling, cycling, fishing, hunting, and sailing. Other hobbies.

The metre is now officially defined as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458th of a second. In the imperial system of measurement, one metre is equal to about 39.37 inches, 3.28 feet, or about 1.09 yards. Units based on the metre. \"*Note: units in bold are the most commonly used.\"",
   "Animalia": "Animalia is the name of the animal kingdom. It is a kingdom which contains all animals. Animals are living things which do not make use of light to get energy and building materials (like plants do) to grow. They eat plants or other animals. Most higher animals can also move around, which is another difference with plants. Animals are divided into groups as well. Grouping animals. When scientists look at animals, they find things that certain animals have in common. They can then group the animals, according to some of these things. One classification is that some animals have a backbone, and others do not. The animals with a backbone are called vertebrates, those without one are called invertebrates. Examples of invertebrates are bees, dragonflies, jellyfish, etc. The problem with this classification though is that most animals are invertebrates. Therefore, other classifications are used more often, today. The vertebrate phylum is more commonly known as chordata. There are many other phylums, and every other one of them contain invertebrates.",
   "Cologne": "Cologne (or sometimes \"K\u00f6lle\") is a city on the Rhine River in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia Germany. About 970,000 people live there. The city was founded by the Romans in the year 50, but before that, it was a Roman castle (\"castellum\") and a town with inhabitants of the local German tribe named \"Ubier\" at least for 100 years.. There had been people living in the area during stone age. The most interesting thing to see there is Cologne Cathedral. This church was built from about 1248 to about 1550, but finally finished in 1880. The United Nations list it as 'World Cultural Heritage'. Cologne's archbishop Rainald von Dassel brought the relics of the biblical Three Wise Men there in 1164. They are kept in a very beautiful golden shrine Three golden crowns in the coat of arms of the city symbolize them. They made Cologne a major place of pilgrimage. Traditionally, the city was always Roman Catholic. That changed only recently after the Second World War, as a result of massive immigration of protestants from the East of Germany. Still the majority of 41,6% is Roman Catholic, compared to 17% Protestant. 10% of the population are muslim Cologne is the biggest city in North Rhine-Westphalia. The University of Cologne alone has more than 50,000 students. It was founded 1919 and is one of the biggest in Germany. There are several specialized Schools in addition to the university. The \"Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik\" is the biggest Academy of Music in Europe. Cologne has two Colleges of Arts and the Sports College again is one of the biggest worldwide. Cologne has one of the busiest train stations in Europe. It is the only train station located next to a big cathedral. People in Cologne and nearby have their own language. They call it K\u00f6lsch. During carnival time it even appears on nationwide broadcasts. Cologne has a handful of broadcasting stations. The Westdeutscher Rundfunk, part of the network ARD, is the biggest producer of television and radio programs in Germany. Cologne is in the southern part of the 'Rhine-Ruhr agglomeration' of cities, where there live about 10 million people. This is one of the most densely populated areas of the world.",
   "Central America": "Central America is a region between Guatemala and Belize in the North, and Panama at the South. They are all Spanish speaking countries, apart from Belize, whose people also speak English. Central America is part of the continent known as North America.",
   "Circle": "A circle is a round two-dimensional shape, such as the letter \"o\". The centre of a circle is the point in the very middle. The radius of a circle is a line from the centre of the circle to a point on the side. All points on the circle are at the same distance from the centre. In other words, the radius is the same length all the way around the circle. Mathematicians use the letter \"r\" for the length of a circle's radius. The diameter (meaning \"all the way across\") of a circle is a straight line that goes from one side to the opposite and right through the centre. Mathematicians use the letter \"d\" for the length of this line. The diameter of a circle is equal to twice its radius (\"d\" equals 2 times \"r\"). The circumference (meaning \"all the way around\") of a circle is line that goes around the circle. Mathematicians use the letter \"c\" for the length of this line. The number \"\u03c0\" (written as the Greek letter \"pi\") is a very useful number. It is the length of the circumference divided by the length of the diameter (\"\u03c0\" equals \"c\" divided by \"d\"). The number \u03c0 is equal to about or 3.14159. The area, \"a\", inside a circle is equal to the radius multiplied by itself, then multiplied by \u03c0 (\"a\" equals \u03c0 times (\"r\" times \"r\")). Calculating \u03c0. \u03c0 can be empirically measured by drawing a large circle, then measuring its diameter and circumference, since the circumference of a circle is always \u03c0 times its diameter.",
   "Summary": "A summary is a short version of something, for instance a movie or a book or an article. It tells you the main things in the movie or article or book in a short way and leaving out the details (the less important things). Many scientific journals publish a summary for every large article so people who do not have much time can read the main information quickly without spending too much time reading the article. Before one can deduce the summary of a comprehension, one should fully understand the comprehension. That is by reading the first time, second and preferably third. Use of windy statements and lengthy words in order to impress the examiner is not preferable. Just a short and small combination of words do the job. For example 1. George now knows that his friend Clooney can cheaply fall into any of his pranks. 2. Birds of the same altitude and traits seems to walk in the same conglomeration. 1.George can easily deceive his friend 2.Birds of the same feather flock together. Notice the use of \"words\" to explain many \"words\".George can easily for George now knows that his friend Clooney can cheaply fall. Birds of the same altitude and traits seems for Also one should know that summary does cosnumes many time dedicated to give out the best summary and not somthing you think it is simple. 1. Don't use windy statements or lengthy expressions 2. In Summary, avoid extreneous words 3. Try to fathom the comprehension passage very well. 4. Abide with rules e.g You may be asked to write your summary in one sentence or two. Breeching this instruction may result to loss of marks or none at all.",
   "Defense": "Defense or defence is protecting something from attack. Military. A country's government may form an army, a navy, and/or an air force to protect the country and its people from attacks. The army, navy, and air force can also be used to attack other countries. A country can also use the military to kill or arrest people, or members of groups, from other countries who have hurt or killed their own citizens. In these groups, people are specially trained to use weapons such as rifles and artillery, that can be used to kill other soldiers and destroy their equipment. Together, these groups form a country's military. Some governments, like the United States' government, spend large amounts of money every year to buy and keep weapons and to pay people to defend their countries. These trained people are called soldiers. A country's armed forces can also be used for non-military jobs, such as delivering food aid to hungry people, filling sandbags during a flood, bringing doctors and nurses to poor people in foreign countries to help them when they're sick, or helping put out forest fires. Sometimes, when a country's army is doing a lot of work in different places, and there are not enough soldiers to do more work, a country can hire civilians who are not members of the military to do some of the army's jobs, like protecting buildings, important people, and groups of trucks travelling from one place to another. This lets the country to use their military for other jobs. Usually, these people hired by a country this way used to be members of the military before leaving and working for other people, companies and countries. Law. In legal matters, the defense is the person or people who are charged with a crime in a court case, along with their lawyer. The arguments and evidence that they provide to prove they did not commit the crime is also called their defense.",
   "Test": "A test is a way of checking something to see if it is true or if it works. If something can be tested, it is testable. People. People are tested to see what they have learned. This is often called an assessment or examination. In education, a test item is a question, or set of questions on a test. People and animals can also be tested for illnesses. For example, a blood test can be used to check for disease. Science. In science, tests are called experiments. These are done to check for a presence of a substance, or to check the quality of the thing being tested. Software. In software engineering, a test is used to determine a characteristic of a software system. Software is tested before it is released. \"Alpha\" testing is where software developers check the software for bugs. Software can also be checked for quality and usability. \"Beta\" testing is done by groups of users. Vehicles. Cars and other vehicles are tested using a crash test. The car is put under severe conditions to see what will make it fail. Other machines can also be crash tested. Crash test dummies stand in for humans. They 'sit' in the car seat to see if a human in the crash would have been injured or killed. Crash tests cost a lot of money. Other. The River Test is a chalk stream in the south of England. The river is used a lot for trout fishing. The river starts near Overton, in Hampshire and ends at the sea at the head of Southampton Water.",
   "Long jump": "The long jump is a sport in athletics (track and field), where a athletes compete by comparing lengths of jumps. where athletes try to jump as far as they can. The athlete runs as fast as they can down the run way to the jumping pit which is made of sand. when they are at the mark where they are told to jump, the athlete jumps as far as they can into the sand pit.",
   "Buddhism": "Buddhism teaches people how to reduce their suffering by understanding themselves better. Some see it as a religion, other people think it is a philosophy and for others, Buddhism is a way of finding reality. The teachings of Gautama Buddha - a man who lived between about 563 and 483 BC - tell us how to live a good life. The Buddha was a rich prince. He gave up everything to work out how best to live. His teachings started in India and slowly spread, after his death, through most of Asia, to Central Asia, Tibet, Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, and the East Asian countries of China, Mongolia, Korea, and Japan and has now spread to the West. Background. The Buddha's teachings are about suffering and how to overcome it. Overcoming suffering allows a person to be truly happy. Buddha taught that if people make good decisions they would be happy and have peace of mind. Buddha taught that life is imperfect and that we will suffer (Dukkha). He taught that we suffer because of desire, anger and stupidity, and he showed that we could end our suffering by letting go of desires and overcoming anger and stupidity. The complete letting go of these negative influences is called Nirvana, meaning \"to extinguish\", like putting out the flame of a candle. The end of suffering, when one is fully awake (put an end to one's own ignorance) and has let go of all desire and anger, is also called Enlightenment. In Buddhism Enlightenment and Nirvana mean the same thing. Buddhism teaches non-harm and \"moderation\" or balance, not going too far one way or the other. Buddhists often meditate, or think deeply, while sitting in a special or specific way. They often chant and meditate while walking. Buddhists sometimes do these things to understand the human heart and mind. Sometimes they do these things to understand the way the world works. Sometimes they do these things to find peace. Buddhism does not say if gods exist or not, but one can read many stories about gods in Buddhist books. Buddhists do not believe that people should look to gods to save them or bring them enlightenment. The gods may have power over world events and they might help people, or they might not. But it's up to each person to get to \"enlightenment\". Many Buddhists honor gods in ritual. Many believe the stories about gods are just there to help us learn about parts of ourselves. What is a Buddha? \"Buddha\" is a word in the very old Indian languages P\u0101li and Sanskrit which means \"Enlightened one\". The word \"Buddha\" often means the historical Buddha named Buddha Shakyamuni (Siddhartha Gautama), but \"Buddha\" does not mean just one man who lived at a certain time. It is used for a type of person, the equivalent of a prophet, and there have been many. There were Buddhas a very long time ago, and there will be for a long time in the future. A Buddha is a human being who has woken up and can see the true way the world works. This knowledge totally changes the person. Some say this puts them beyond birth, death, and rebirth. Others think this represents the final extinction of desire. This person can help others become \"enlightened\" too. To learn more, read: Buddha. Who was the first Buddha? According to Buddhism, there were countless Buddhas before Gautama Buddha and there will be many Buddhas after him. In short, he is not the first, nor will he be the last. However, counting from the present \"kalpa\" (the beginning of our present universe) Buddha Gautama is considered the fourth Buddha. The first is Gakusandho Buddha, second Gonakamano Buddha and the third Gassapo Buddha. The last Buddha of this \"kalpa\" will be Mettaya Buddha. Then the universe will renew itself and from then begins a new \"kalpa\". Old stories say that Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama was born around the 6th century BC. He was the one who would become the first Buddha in written history. Some Buddhists believe that Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama was a perfect person. He was born a prince, but he wanted to learn the answer to the problem of human \"suffering\", or pain. He gave up all his money and power, and became a monk without a home. He walked from place to place, trying to learn the answers to life. At last he found enlightenment while sitting under a big tree called the \"Bodhi Tree\". He was the first person to teach \"Buddhism\" to the people, and \"Buddhists\" love him for that. After Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama died, his students taught the Buddha's teaching to more people. After a long time, they wrote down the things that he may have said. To learn more, read: Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama. The Three Jewels. Buddhists often talk about the \"Three Jewels\", which are the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. The Dharma is the way the Buddha taught to live your life. The Sangha is the group of monks and other people who meet together, like a congregation. Buddhists say \"I take \"refuge\" in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha.\" This means that these three things keep them safe. They give themselves up to the community and teachings inspired by the Buddha. Four Noble Truths. The Buddha's first and most important teachings are the Four Noble Truths. Five Precepts. Most Buddhists follow five \"precepts\", or rules, that say what not to do. The Buddha taught that killing, stealing, having sex in a harmful way, and lying are not signs of skill. In some types of Buddhism, when a person wants to be a monk, he will follow other \"precepts\" also.",
   "Special English": "Special English is a simple form of the English language used by a public radio station called Voice of America, run by United States government in daily Special English programs. Its news and feature programs are read more slowly than usual, using a limited number of English words and simple grammar. For those whose mother language is not English, it is much easier to understand contents of programs, because it sounds clearer and simpler, and shorter sentences are used in articles. It can also help someone whose English is weak to improve his or her English. In some countries, for example China, Special English is more and more popular among people learning English.

   "Software": "Software is short for computer software. It means the applications and operating systems used with computers. The term software was first used in the late 1960s to show the difference from computer hardware, which are the fixed parts of a machine. Before compact discs (CDs) or Internet downloads, applications and operating systems came on soft media like magnetic discs and magnetic tape. Software is an essential part of today's society. Basically software tells the hardware when to do a specific task. The advancement of software is ever-changing and developers are creating different kinds programs to help businesses, corporates and everyone around the world. Gone are the days of filing information manually, with today's software everything is done in a fraction of the time.",
   "Pint": "The pint is the name of a unit of liquid measurement in some countries. The pint is defined as of a gallon. Because the imperial system and the American system use different gallons, their pints are different also. The imperial pint is still used to measure beer in the countries of the old British Empire. It is usually not used today for anything else. It is divided into 20 fluid ounces. The United States is the only other country to use pints. In the American system there are two pints. There is a wet pint and a dry pint. Six U.S. wet pints are about five imperial pints. The U.S. wet pint is divided into 16 fluid ounces.",
   "Classical element": "The Greek classical elements are fire, air, water, and earth. In Greek philosophy, science and medicine, these make up a whole. The image below has two squares on top of each other. The corners of one are the classical elements. The corners of the other are the properties. Galen said these elements were used by Hippocrates to describe the human body. The elements are linked to the four humours: phlegm (water), yellow bile (fire), black bile (earth), and blood (air). In Chinese Taoism the elements are metal, wood, water, fire, earth (\u91d1\u3001\u6728\u3001\u6c34\u3001\u706b\u3001\u571f).",
   "Boil": "To boil water is to make it hot so that it begins to make bubbles and turns into steam. Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit). At high altitudes in the mountains, water boils at a lower temperature, because of the lower atmospheric pressure in high places. To boil food is to cook it in boiling water.

The infection is caused by the bacteria \"Staphylococcus aureus\".",
   "Peace": "Peace is a time without any fights or wars. In a larger sense, peace (or peacefulness) can mean a state of harmony, quiet or calm that is not disturbed by anything at all, like a still pond with no ripples. Peace within and among states is a goal of many people and organizations. One organization that was set up to bring peace among the nations and try to make war a thing of the past was the League of Nations after World War I. When it failed to stop World War II, it was replaced by the United Nations which tries to make the world peaceful by standing for collective security between all the members. This means that if any member is attacked or invaded by another country without attacking that country first, the other members will come to help the country that was attacked first. This idea was used by the United Nations to defend both South Korea and Kuwait when they were attacked. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote in a that, \"True peace is not merely the absence of tension: it is the presence of justice.\" In other words, Real peace is more than just problems being gone: there must be fairness to have peace.",

In physics, velocity is a \"vector quantity\", meaning that it not only indicates speed, but also the direction of movement. The current understanding of physics holds that \"c,\" the speed of light through a vacuum (about 300 million \"meters per second\"), is the highest limit of velocity for anything that can be touched. In other words, this means nothing can go faster than the speed of light.",

Andouille sausage first came from France or Germany (no-one is sure), and the most famous sort in the USA is the \"Cajun\" style. Other sorts are \"French andouille\" and \"German andouille\"; they are less spicy than Cajun. Cajun has extra salt, black pepper, and garlic. Andouille makers smoke the sausages over pecan wood and sugar cane for a maximum of seven or eight hours, at about 175 degrees Fahrenheit (80 degrees Celsius).",
   "Name": "Name is a word (or a set of words) given to things and people. For example, \"cat\" is the name of a kind of animal. \"Ryan\" is a name of a person. The word 'name' can also be used as a verb. To name something is to give it a name. People's names. In many cultures, there are rules and customs about how to give a person a name. Some of the rules are defined by laws, and others are defined by traditions (doing things in the way they have been done for a long time). 1. Number of parts of a name In some cultures, a person has a one-part name, such as \"ShiningWater.\" In other cultures, a person has a two-part name, such as \"John Smith.\" In some cultures, a person can have any number of name parts. In the United States, for example, some people have three: first name, middle name, and last name. Other people have only two: a first and last name. In Chinese cultures, it is typical for a person to have three-part name, such as \"Cheah Ching San.\" Where \"Cheah\" is the surname. Written in English format a comma is introduced making it \"Ching San, Cheah.\" 2. Relations with names of parents and other relatives In some cultures, people have the same \"family name\" (or surname) as their parents. For example, the father of John Smith may be Mike Smith. And Mike Smith's father may be James Smith. The \"Smith\" part is the same for all the family. In other cultures, a person has the same name as his or her father, but the name is in a different place. For example, Shafiq Hanif's son may be Hanif Kamal. Hanif is in both the father's and son's name. In some cultures, a name changes when people marry, divorce, go through some religious ceremony, etc. For example, in some Spanish-speaking countries, people use two last names: their mother's father's name and their father's name. If Elena Rodriguez Gomez and Jose Sanchez Soria marry, she may change her name to Elena Rodriguez de Sanchez, and their child could be named Pilar Sanchez Rodriguez, taking the names of both of her grandfathers. In some cultures, personal names come from history. In most European countries, some first names are taken from the Bible. In some cultures, names are taken from a relative. In other cultures, a name shows what the parents hope their child will be like. A baby may be given a name Wisdom because parents hope the baby will be a wise girl or boy. Some cultures avoid giving people a name of an animal. For example, there is no name like dog, cat, snake, owl, or fish in Japanese people's first names. But in some cultures animal names may be good. In some languages and cultures, you can tell if a word is a person's name or not by just looking at the spelling or listening to its pronunciation. There are some other linguistic patterns. For example, many Chinese names are made up of three syllables. 6. Use of names, titles, nicknames, etc. In some cultures, people use names when they call each other. In other cultures, people use their nicknames. In some other cultures, people use their titles (\"father,\" \"professor,\" etc.) when they call each other. 7. Spelling of names, titles, nicknames, etc. In the English language, names exclusively are usually pronounced in correlation with the spelling, however can be pronounced as desired, eg. John is (jon) but can also be (ned). However not probable, is held true in the English rules of grammar. Japanese names. Here are some things that are often found in Japanese names today. In the past, people went by different rules. 1. Number of parts of a name Japanese names have two parts. One is the family name and the other is the given name. \"Suzuki Ichiro\" is a name of a Japanese person. Suzuki is the family name, and Ichiro is the first name. In the Japanese language, the family name comes first, and the given name comes second. (It is like writing Smith John, instead of John Smith.) Only some members of the royal family do not have a family name. 2. Relations with names of parents and other relatives A newborn baby gets a family name from their parents. The parents have the same family name. So, a son of Ono Yoko (female) and Ono Ken (male) is Ono something. The family name Ono is mostly shared by the paternal (male) part of the family. So Ono Ken's parents have the family name Ono, but Ono Yoko's parents probably do not. Names of people change when they marry and divorce. It is a custom in many parts of the world that women change their family name to that of their new husband when they marry. However, in Europe and North America especially, many women no longer do this even though their mothers and grandmothers may have. Sometimes, the man will take the woman's family name. 6. Use of names, titles, nicknames, etc.",
   "London Borough of Greenwich": "The London Borough of Greenwich is a London Borough. It is in south east London.",
   "Movie": "Movies (also known as films or motion pictures) are a type of visual communication which use moving pictures and sound to tell stories or inform (help people to learn about new ideas). People in every part of the world watch movies as a type of entertainment; a way to have fun. Fun for some people can mean laughing, while for others it can mean crying, or feeling afraid. Most movies are made so that they can be shown on big screens at cinemas or movie theatres. After movies are shown on cinema screens for a period of time (ranging from a few weeks to several months), movies are shown on pay television or cable television, and sold or rented on DVD disks or videocassette tapes, so that people can watch the movies at home. Later, movies are shown on television stations. How movies work. A movie camera or video camera takes pictures very quickly, usually at 24 pictures (frames) every second. When a movie projector, a computer, or a television shows the pictures at that rate, it looks like the images on the screen are moving. Sound is either recorded at the same time, or added later. The sounds in a movie usually include the sounds of people talking (which is called dialogue), music (which is called the \"soundtrack\"), and 'Foley', the sounds of activities that are happening in the movie (such as doors opening or guns being fired). How movies are made. A screenwriter writes a script, which is the story of the movie with the words that the actors will say. Then a producer hires people to work on the movie and gets all of the money that will be needed to pay for the actors and the equipment. Producers usually get the money by borrowing it from a bank or by getting investors to lend money to the movie production. Some producers work for a movie studio; other producers are independent (they do not work for a movie studio). Actors and directors read scripts to find out what to say and what to do. The actors memorize the words from the script that they will say in the movie, and learn the actions that the script tells them to do. Then the director tells the actors what to do and a cameraman takes motion pictures of them with a motion picture camera. When filming has finished, an editor puts the moving pictures together in a way that tells the whole story within a set amount of time. Audio engineers and sound engineers record music and singing and join it with the moving pictures. When the movie is done, many copies of the movie are made by movie labs and put onto movie reels. Then the movie reels are sent to cinemas. An electric machine called a projector shines a very bright light through the movie, and people sitting in a dark room see it on a big screen. Genres. A genre is a word for a type of movie or a style of movie. Movies can be fictional (made up), or true, or a mix of the two. Although hundreds of movies are made every year, there are very few that do not follow a small number of set plots, or stories. Some movies mix together two or more genres. Dramas are serious, and often about people falling in love or people who have to make a big decision in their life. They tell stories about relationships between people. They usually follow a basic plot where one or two main characters (each actor plays a character) have to 'overcome' (get past) an obstacle (the thing stopping them) to get what they want. Tragedies are always dramas. For example, a husband and wife who are divorcing must each try to prove to a court of law that they are the best person to take care of their child (\"Kramer versus Kramer\"). Emotion (feelings) are a big part of the movie and the audience (people watching the film) may get upset and even cry. Action movies have a lot of exciting effects like car chases and gun fights, involving stuntmen. They usually involve 'goodies' and 'baddies', so war and crime are common subjects. Action films usually need very little effort to watch, since the plot is normally simple. For example terrorists take control of a skyscraper and ask for a lot of money in exchange for not killing the people who work there. One man somehow manages to save everyone and is the hero (\"Die Hard\"). Action movies do not usually make people cry, but if the action movie is also a drama, emotion will be involved. For example, four brothers go off to fight in the 2nd World War and 3 are soon killed. Someone decides that the 4th brother must be saved. He and the soldiers who rescue him end up fighting the enemy and the soldier who led his squad trying to save the 4th brother is killed and becomes a hero (\"Saving Private Ryan\"). Thrillers are usually about a mystery, strange event, or crime that needs to be solved. The audience is kept guessing until the final minutes, when there are usually 'twists' in the plot (surprises). Comedies are funny movies about people being silly or doing unusual things that make the audience laugh. Romantic Comedies (Rom-Coms) are usually love stories about 2 people from different worlds, who must overcome obstacles to be together. Rom-Coms are always light-hearted, but may include some emotion. Buddy movies involve 2 heroes, one must save the other, both must overcome obstacles. Buddy movies often involve comedy, but there is also some emotion, because of the close friendship between the 'buddies'. Example: the \"Lethal Weapon\" series or \"Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid\". Science fiction movies are set in the future or in outer space. Some use their future or alien settings to ask questions about the meaning of life or how we should think about life. Science fiction movies often use special effects to create images of alien worlds, outer space, alien creatures, and spaceships, for example the \"Alien\" series. Western movies tell stories about cowboys living in the western United States in the 1800s. They are usually really Action movies, but with historical costume. They may or may not involve Indians (Native Americans). Horror films use fear to excite the audience. Music, lighting and sets (man-made places in film studios where the film is made) are all designed to add to the feeling. Animated movies use childish images like talking pigs to tell a story. These films used to be drawn by hand, one frame at a time, but are now made on computers. The first major animated film, still highly respected by audiences and the movie industry is \"Fantasia\" by Walt Disney, made in 1946. This film has no dialogue (speaking) but uses Classical music. Simple stories are shown with action being in time to the music. For example pigs dressed as ballet dancers dance to the \"Nutcracker Suite' by Tchaikovsky. Documentaries are movies that are (or claim to be) about real people and real events. They are nearly always serious and may involve strongly emotional subjects, for example cruelty. Movie noir movies are 1940s-era detective movies about crime and violence. The business of making movies. Movies can make profits in the hundreds of millions, be they dollars, euro or pounds. In India movies have become an enormous part of the economy. The industry has always been dominated by quite a small number of major studios, like MGM, Warner, Columbia or Paramount. There are many large companies that provide all of the services needed to make movies, such as special effects, lighting, set building. Many of these employees belong to unions who say how much their members must be paid. A huge number of smaller companies also offer services, such as music studios (which record the music for original movie soundtracks) and CGI (computer generated imagery. Finally there are movie distribution companies (which send movies around the world or around a country), and advertising companies who let people know about the film. Movies with famous stars and large budgets (lots of money), are designed to have a wide appeal, so that hopefully millions of people will pay to see them. Movies like this, which always cost the most to make, are called blockbusters. Special effects can add a huge amount to the cost of a film, especially the newest CGI effects, but people have come to expect them and every blockbuster film tries to out-do the last. Today in 2008, some films can cost up to $200 million to make. But when you stop to think that very successful films can make many times that amount in profit, it is easy to see why the studios keep producing them. This kind of movie will have a lot of promotion through television advertising, billboards and internet sites. In blockbuster movies, there is usually a happy ending, in which all of the problems in the plot (story) are figured out or fixed and almost everyone (except the baddie) live happily ever after. Some films have been so successful that the studios keep releasing more and more films with the same characters and basic plots, for example the James Bond films and Star Wars. At the opposite end of the scale to the blockbuster, there is the independent, art, or Indie movie. These are usually made by small movie companies, or even just a small group of people that do not have much money. An example is The Blair Witch Project, which cost only about $60,000, but which has so far taken perhaps $200 million in ticket and DVD sales. Films like this are very unusual and usualy become popular 'underground' (people tell each other about it), so that they become cult, or popular but not mainstream. Independent movies often tell more creative or unusual (strange) stories, or may have sad endings that do not appeal to the big studios, because they can't be sure how the public will react to them. They rarely make a lot of money, but if they are successful, the big studios will quickly try to get the people involved to sign a contract with them, by offering them a lot of money to make another film. It is often the case that the new film, with its big budget and its stars will be less successful than the first, for example Blair Witch Project 2. Famous actresses. Note: the word actress is rarely used any more in the US film industry, male and female are all simply actors.",
   "Romania": "Romania (dated: Rumania, Roumania;,) is a country that can be found in the south-eastern part of Central Europe. It is found to the north of the Balkan Peninsula, on the Lower Danube. It is also within and outside the Carpathian arch, and is bordering the Black Sea. Most of the Danube Delta is found inside Romania. It shares a border with Hungary and Serbia to the west, Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova to the northeast, and Bulgaria to the south. Romania is a semi-presidential unitary state. Romania was made by the joining of Moldavia and Wallachia in 1859. It was given its independence in the 1878. At the end of World War II, some of its territories (around what is now known as Moldova) was occupied by the USSR. After the Iron Curtain fell in 1989, Romania started political and economical reforms that let Romania join the European Union on 1 January 2007. Romania has the 9th biggest territory and the 7th biggest population (with 22 million people) of the European Union member states. The capital and biggest city in Romania is Bucharest (), with a population of 1.9 million people. One of the cities in Transylvania, Sibiu, was named a European Capital of Culture. Romania also joined NATO on March 29, 2004. Origin. \"Romania\" (\"Rumania\" or \"Rom\u00e2nia\") comes from the Romanian word \"Rom\u00e2n\", which comes from the Latin word \"Romanus\" (\"Roman\"). English sources still used the word Rumania during World War II. This comes from the French word \"Roumania\". This is the last known mention. Prehistory and Antiquity. The oldest human remains to have been found in Europe were found in Romania. They were about 42,000 years old. Being that they are Europe's oldest human remains, this may have been when the first people came to Europe. The first written proof of people living in what is now Romania comes from Herodotus in the fourth book of his Histories (Herodotus). The book was written in about 440 BCE. He wrote that the Getae were defeated by the Persian Emperor Darius the Great when he was battling the Scythians. Dacians, who were mostly thought of as a part of the Getae, were part of the Thracians who were living in Dacia (which is where Romania, Moldova and the northern part of Bulgaria are). The Roman Empire first noticed Dacia when they attacked the Roman province, which was bordered by the Danube, in 87 AD. This was during Emperor Domitian's rule. In time, the Dacians were finished by the Roman Empire under Emperor Trajan in two battles that lasted from 101 AD until 106 AD. After the Dacians were defeated, the Roman Empire turned Dacia into the province of Roman Dacia. A lot of very good ore deposits were found in Roman Dacia. There was a lot of gold and silver found in Roman Dacia, and a large portion of gold and silver were found in the Western Carpathians. Trajan brought home 165 tons of gold and 330 tons of silver when he returned home after his conquest. The Romans had a lot of people living in the colony of Roman Dacia, and brought with them Vulgar Latin, which they started to put a lot of effort into romanization. This was to become the first version of Romanian. In the 3rd century, several new kinds of people that moved around a lot made the Roman Empire leave Dacia near 271 AD. This became the Roman Empire's first abandoned province. The origin of modern Romanians is widely debated by historians to this day. It is thought that the Romanians were formed from big ethnic groups that came from both the south and north of the Danube. Middle Ages. In 271 or 275 AD, the Goths took over the abandoned Roman province. They lived in Dacia until the 4th century, when another group of wandering peoples, the Huns, came to Dacia. The Gepids, and the Avars with the Slavic people, was in control of Transylvania through the 8th century. In the 8th century, however, it was overrun by Bulgarians, where it was made part of the First Bulgarian Empire, which ended Romania's Dark Ages. The Bulgarians held Transylvania until the 11th century. The Pechenegs, the Cumans, and the Uzes were a few of the people later noted in the history of Romania. In 1310, Basarab I started the Romanian principalities of Wallachia in what were called the High Middle Ages and Moldavia by Drago\u015f around 1352. During the Middle Ages, Romanians were living in three different areas: Wallachia (Romanian: \"\u0162ara Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103\"\u2014\"Romanian Land\"), Moldavia (Romanian: \"Moldova\") and Transylvania. Transylvania belonged to the Kingdom of Hungary from around the 10th century until the 16th century, when it turned into the Principality of Transylvania. The Principality of Transylvania lasted until 1711. Wallachia has always been on the border of the Ottoman Empire since the 14th century. As the Ottoman Empire's influence grew, it gradually fell under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century. The best known ruler of this period was Vlad III the Impaler (also known as Vlad Dracula or ',), Prince of Wallachia during the years of 1448, 1456\u201362, and 1476. While he was the leader of his people, he had a pact with the Ottoman Empire to stay independent. Many people in Romania during this time thought of him as a ruler with a great sense of justice and defense for his country. Moldavia was seeing its' best of times when Stephen the Great was ruling Moldavia between 1457 and 1504. He was a very good leader of the military (He won 47 battles, and lost 2)). After every battle he won, Stephen would build a church. Because he won 47 of the battles that he fought, he ended up building 48 churches. After Stephen the Great's death, Moldavia became under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire during the 16th century. Independence and monarchy. When the Austro-Hungarian Empire was in control of Transylvania, and the Ottoman Empire was in control of Wallachia and Moldavia, almost all of the Romanians were second-class citizens or non-citizens. They stayed this way even when they made up most of the people in those areas. In 1848, the 1848 Revolution did not succeed, and the Great Powers did not like the idea of Romania becoming an independent nation. The people who chose who was elected in 1859 in Moldavia and Wallachia picked the same person \u2013 Alexandru Ioan Cuza \u2013 as the prince in those areas. This made Romania into a personal union, which happens when the same person rules two different areas. The personal union did not include Transylvania, because most of the people that were living there in the upper class were still Hungarian. In 1866, a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" resulted in Cuza being exiled or not allowed into that part of the country. Prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen became the prince after the exile, and was later called Prince Carol of Romania. While the Russo-Turkish War was happening, Romania battled on the Russian side. When the 1878 Treaty of Berlin, was signed, it made Romania an independent state by the Great Powers. However, they had to give Russia three of their southern districts of of Bessarabia. In 1881, the principality became a kingdom with Prince Carol ruling as its' King Carol I. World War I. During August of the year 1914, when World War I started, Romania said it was a neutral country. In 1916, after pressure from the Allies, Romania joined the Allies. Romania then started a war with Austria-Hungary. The Romanian military campaign was really bad for Romania. The Central Powers took over most of the country. Much of the Romanian army were either captured or killed over four months. Moldova was one of the only parts of Romania that was not captured when it stopped its' attackers in 1917. By the time World War I was over, Austria-Hungary and the Russian Empire had fallen apart. This event allowed Bessarabia, Bukovina and Transylvania to become part of the Kingdom of Romania again in 1918. After the Treaty of Trianon was signed in 1920, Hungary, as agreed, gave up the claims of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy over Transylvania. Romania and Bukovina were joined together in 1919 as a result of the Treaty of Saint Germain. Bessarabia joined with Romania in 1920 when the Treaty of Paris was signed. Greater Romania. The words Rom\u00e2nia Mare (which means \"Great Romania\" when translated directly from the Romanian language, but usually is translated as \"Greater Romania\") is what people called Romania during the time between wars. They called Romania Rom\u00e2nia Mare because Romania was in control of (almost 300,000 square kilometers) of land. This was the most land that Romania was ever in control of. World War II. In World War II, Romania called itself neutral. However, on 28 June 1940, a Soviet ultimatum said that they would invade Romania if they didn't join the Axis. Because of the pressure from Moscow and Berlin, they left Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to avoid war. This, along with other events, made Romania think about joining the Axis powers. As a result, Bulgaria was given the southern part of Dobruja while Hungary was given Northern Transylvania. This loss of land caused King Carol II, the king of Romania at the time, to abdicate the throne in 1940. The National Legionary State then came into power. Power without the National Legionary State was shared by Ion Antonescu and the Iron Guard. Ion Antonescu then defeated the Iron Guard and a year later, Romania joined the war on the Axis Power's side. Over the course of World War II, Romania was the source for most of the oil of Nazi Germany. This caused many bombing raids (where airplanes attempted to drop bombs on important places) by the Allies. Ion Antonescu's rule played a big part in the Halocaust. During August of the year 1944, Antonescu lost power and was arrested by King Michael I of Romania. As a result of this, Romania changed sides and joined the Allies. However, even though they helped to defeat Nazi Germany, they were not noted in the Paris Peace Conference of 1947. People of the Red Army stayed in the country and Communists got most of the votes using some forms of cheating. This included tampering with the votes and killing other party members that didn't agree with them. This gave them control of the country. By the end of the war, 300,000 people in the Romanian Army were killed. Romania and communism. King Michael I was abdicated and had the leave Romania in 1947 because of the Communists. Romania was then called a republic. The USSR kept control of Romania until late in the 1950s, when the Soviet troops agreed to leave Romania. During this time, resources in Romania dropped a lot because of agreements made by the communists. After the Soviet troops left Romania, Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu wanted Romania to become independent. Because of this, Romania started following independent policies like opening talks with Israel after the Six-Day War in 1967 and starting relations with the Federal Republic of Germany.. Romania also started to make friends with the Arab countries. By being friends with the Arab countries, Romania was allowed take part in peace talks between Israel and Egypt and between Israel and the PLO. These caused the amount of money that Romania owed to other countries to go up from 3 billion dollars to nearly 10 billion dollars between the years of 1977 and 1981. The amount of debt that Romania owed other countries caused them to rely on banks and other such companies from around the world. This fought with Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu's autarchic ways and caused him to want to give back all the money that they got from the companies. This caused Romanians to become poor and took out the economy. These events caused Ceau\u015fescu to be taken out of power and killed in the Romanian Revolution of 1989. 1989 to present day. In 1989, the National Salvation Front came into power. It was led by Ion Iliescu. When they came into power, several other parties from before the war were born again. These included the Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party, the National Liberal Party and the Romanian Social Democrat Party. During April of the year 1990, As a result of several rallies, protests started. The people who protested did not recognize the results of the election. This was because they thought that members of the National Salvation Front were Communists. More and more people protested, and it became a demonstration, or a big protest. These were called Golaniad. After a time, the demonstration turned violent. When the Front lost power, several other parties came into being. These included the Social Democratic Party, the Democratic Party, as well as some other pre-war parties. The Social Democratic Party ruled Romania from 1990 until the year 1996. Ion Iliescu was the head of state, or person in charge. After the year 1996, several other parties came into power and lost it. In 2004, Traian B\u0103sescu was elected president. After the Cold War, Romania became closer friends with Western Europe. In 2004, Romania joined NATO and hosted the 2008 summit. The country applied in June 1993 for membership in the European Union and became an Associated State of the EU in 1995, an Acceding Country in 2004, and a member on January 1, 2007. Geography. Romania is found in the southeastern part of Europe. It borders the Black Sea and the Danube. The Carpathian Mountains lie in the center. Romania is the biggest country in southeastern Europe by number of people. It has an area of. It is the twelfth-largest country in Europe. Most of Romania's border with Serbia and Bulgaria is made by the Danube. The Danube is joined by the Prut River. The Prut River makes the border with the Republic of Moldova. The Danube then flows into the area of the Black Sea inside of Romania. This makes the Danube Delta. It is a biosphere reserve and a biodiversity World Heritage Site. Some of the other major rivers in Romania are the Siret, the Olt, and the Mure\u015f. The Siret River runs from the north to the south of Moldavia. The Olt River runs from the Carpathian Mountains to Oltenia. The Mure\u015f runs through Transylvania from the east to the west. Landscape. The land in Romania is equal parts mountainous, hilly and low-lying areas. The Carpathian Mountains make up a big part of the center of Romania. 14 of its mountain ranges are taller than 2,000 meters. The tallest mountain in Romania is Moldoveanu Peak (). Rivers. The Danube is the longest river in Romania. It travels about 1,075 kilometers through Romania. That is almost half of its' length. Nearly all of the rivers in Romania are either direct or indirect tributaries of the Danube. Weather. Romania has a climate that changes between temperate and continental climates. The reason for the climate changes is because of where Romania is found in relation to the coast. Romania has four different seasons. The average temperature during the year is 11\u00b0C in the southern part of Romania and in the northern part. Lots of rain, snow, and other precipitation falls on the highest western mountains. Most of this falls as snow. This makes Romania have good skiing. In the south-centern parts of the country, the amount of rain and snow that falls is around. In the Danube Delta, not much rain falls. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Romania was -37.3\u00b0F, which was found near Bra\u015fov in the year 1944. The highest temperature ever recorded in Romania was 112\u00b0F, which was found near Calafat in the 1950s. Society. In the year 2002, Romania had a population of around 21,698,181 people. Romanians make up 89.5% of the population. There are a few other minorities in Romania. Hungarians make up about 6.5% of the population in Romania. The Romas make up about 2.5% of the people that live in Romania. In Transylvania, A lot of Hungarians live there. They also make up a big part of the counties Harghita and Covasna. Ukrainians, Germans, Lipovans, Turks, Tatars, Serbs, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Croats, Greeks, Russians, Jews, Czechs, Poles, Italians, Armenians, and a few other denominations are what the rest of the people are made up of in Romania. Language. The official language of Romania is Romanian. The Romanian language is an Eastern Romance language. It is similar to the Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Catalan languages. 91% of the population of Romania speaks Romanian as their first language. Hungarian and Rroma are the most important minority languages in Romania. Religion. Romania is a secular state. This means Romania has no national religion. The biggest religious body in Romania is the Romanian Orthodox Church. It is an autocephalous church inside of the Eastern Orthodox communion. This religion made up 86.7% of the population, as of the year 2002. Other religion in Romania include Roman Catholicism (4.7%), Protestantism (3.7%), Pentecostalism (1.5%) and the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church (0.9%). Cities. Bucharest is the capital of Romania. It also is the biggest city in Romania, with a population of over 1.9 million people. There are five other cities in Romania that have a population of more than 300,000 people. The five cities are: Ia\u015fi, Cluj-Napoca, Timi\u015foara, Constan\u0163a, and Craiova. Romania also has five cities that have more than 200,000 people living in them. They include: Gala\u0163i, Bra\u015fov, Ploie\u015fti, Br\u0103ila and Oradea. Thirteen other cities in Romania have a population of more than 100,000 people. Monuments. The UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites includes Romanian sites like the Saxon villages with fortified churches in Transylvania, the painted churches of northern Moldavia, the Wooden Churches of Maramures, the Monastery of Horezu, the citadel of Sighi\u015foara, and the Dacian Fortresses of the Or\u0103\u015ftie Mountains. The reason why Romania stands out in its usage of World Heritage Sites is the fact that they are spread out all over the country, instead of being found all in one place. Culture. Romania has its own culture, mainly because of where it is located. It is this way because it is the point where three different areas meet: Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and the Balkans. These cannot be included in any of those areas. Most of the influences that came to Romania during the old times until the Middle Ages were from Slavic people. Folk music of Romania. Romanian culture is very large: pan flutes, cymbals, alphorns etc. These are folk instruments. Folklore music of Romania influenced the Romanian classical music. The culture of Romania was influenced by the Greeks, Romans, and Slavs. Gheorghe Zamfir is a Romanian singer who sings folklore songs using the panflute. The alphorn is used in Carpathians to communicate over long distances. There are also many traditional dances, for example: \"S\u00e2rba\", \"Hora\"(round dance), and Br\u00e2u. Classical music. The best known Romanian composer is George Enescu, well-known for the Romanian Rapsodies (see also:List of Romanians composers). The Romanian composer Ion Ivanovici composed the waltz \"Waves of Danube\". Literature. A famous Romanian writer is Mihai Eminescu, a writer who wrote poems. Ion Creanga, another writer, wrote many stories and memories. The most famous creation is \"Amintiri din copilarie\"(Memories from chilhood).(See also:List of Romanian writers) Economy. Romania joined the European Union on January 1, 2007. As of now, Romanias' economy is doing all right. Currently, Romania makes around $264 billion in Gross domestic product and a GDP per capita of $12,285. This hasn't always been the case, though. In 1989, after the Communists left Romania, Romanias' economy was in very bad shape. Unemployment was high and the whole economic system was not there and needed help. This period of having a bad economy lasted for about 10 years. In 2000, the people who lead Romania finally started making changes to the economy and the system. People started being able to work again and inflation went down. Divisions. Romania is divided into 41 counties, and the municipality of Bucharest, which is its own county. Romania is divided more into 319 cities and 2,686 communes. Each of the communes has its own council that is led by a mayor.",
   "British English": "British English is the kind of English language which is used in the United Kingdom. Pronunciation (The Way People Say Things) in British English. In the United Kingdom, many different people say words in different ways. For example: a man from a place near London may not say his \"r\"s the same as a man from Scotland or a man from Northern Ireland. In fact, people in some places in the United Kingdom have spoken different languages in the past, and some places still speak those languages today. In some places, the way people speak is changed by knowing the other language, such as Gaelic. Other times, peoples' English accent (the way they sound when they speak English) has been changed by the groups people socialize in. The accent that actors use in television from the BBC is called Received Pronunciation, sometimes called \"The Queen's (or King's) English\", or \"BBC English\". Vocabulary in British English. In British English, \"dock\" refers to the water in the space between two \"piers\" or \"wharfs\". In American English, the \"pier\" or \"wharf\" could be called a \"dock\", and the water between would be a \"slip\".",

   "Noun": "A noun is a kind of word (see part of speech) that is usually the name of a person, place, thing, quality, or idea. In English, nouns can be singular or plural or they can be 1st (first) 2nd (second) or 3rd (third) person. The first person is the person speaking. The second person is the person spoken to and the third person is the person spoken about. Nouns often need a word called an article or determiner (like \"the\" or \"that\"). These words usually don't go with other kinds of words like verbs or adverbs. (For example, people don't say \"I will the go to school\" because \"go\" is a verb.) Adjectives can also describe nouns. In English, there are more nouns than any other kind of word. Every language in the world has nouns, but they are not always used in the same ways. They also can have different properties in different languages. For example, in some other languages, nouns do not change for singular and plural, and sometimes there is no word for \"the\". Some examples of nouns in English are: \"time, people, way, year, government, day, world, life, work, part, number, house, system, company, end, party, information\". The history of the word \"noun\". The word 'noun' comes from the Latin \"nomen\" meaning \"name.\" Words like nouns were described in early days by the Sanskrit grammarian P\u0101\u1e47ini and ancient Greeks like Dionysios Thrax. Uses of nouns. In English sentences, nouns can be used as a subject, object, or complement. They often come after prepositions, as the 'object of preposition'. Nouns can sometimes describe other nouns (such as a soccer ball). When they do this, they are called modifiers. There are also verb forms that can be used in the same way as nouns (such as 'I like \"running\".) These are called \"verbals\" or \"verbal nouns\", and include \"participles\" (which can also be adjectives) and \"infinitives\". Kinds of nouns. Nouns are grouped into common nouns, and proper nouns. There are also pronouns. These have commonly been considered a different part of speech from nouns, but in the past some grammars have included them as nouns as do many modern linguists. Proper nouns. A proper noun (also called proper name) is a name given to individual people, places, companies, or brands. Some examples of proper nouns are: \"London, John, God, October, Mozart, Saturday, Coke, Mr. Brown, Atlantic Ocean\" Proper nouns begin with an upper case (capital) letter in English and many other languages that use the Roman alphabet. (However, in German, all nouns begin with an upper case letter.) The word \"I\" is really a pronoun, although it is capitalized in English, like a proper noun. Some common nouns (see below) can also be used as proper nouns. For example, someone might be named 'Tiger Smith' -- even though he is not a tiger or a smith. Number and countability. In English and many other languages, nouns have 'number'. But some nouns are only singular (such as \"furniture, physics\") and others are only plural (such as \"clothes, police\"). Also, some nouns are 'countable' (they can be counted, for example, \"one piece, two pieces\") but others are not (for example, we don't say \"one furniture, two furnitures\"). How adjectives become nouns. All adjectives without exception can become nouns by placing the word the in front of the adjective. Example: Take the adjective 'beautiful', place the word the in front of it like this, 'the beautiful' and 'beautiful' is no longer an adejective; it is now a noun. Example: \"The beautiful is worthy of admiration\". In the sentence, \"The beautiful flower is on the table\", the word 'beautiful' is an adjective because it describes the noun 'flower'. Most adjectives become nouns by adding the suffix ness. Example: Take the adjective 'natural', add 'ness' to get 'naturalness', a noun.

   "Sense": "When a word has several meanings, one can refer to it as being used \"in the sense of...\" some context or other. In Simple English for instance we avoid using words in unusual senses. A valid seventh sense is the immune system's ability to detect invading virus and bacteria. Memory is sometimes listed as an eighth sense, although it seems not to detect things from outside, but reconstruct them from inside the brain, and sometimes from muscle memory. The obsolete term \"sixth sense\" is used to mean empathy or telepathy, and was in use before kinesthetics was understood. When someone does not like the ideology or logic used in an argument, they often say it makes no sense or is nonsense. A variation of this is to say that something does not make \"economic sense\". Usually these words signal a political dispute or some failure to define terms correctly. The term \"common sense\" is used to mean either wisdom or very stupid ideas shared by many \"common\" people. It has a long history of being used in politics, to mean almost anything.",

   "Black hole": "A black hole is an object in the universe that has such a strong pull of gravity, even light can't escape it. Until recently, many astronomers did not even know if they existed, but by using telescopes and looking at the universe, they found objects with such a very strong force. They decided it was a black hole with a strong gravitational force. This does not mean that the origin of such a strong force can not be something different than gravitational one. History. In 1783, an English geologist named John Michell wrote that it might be possible for something to be so big and heavy that the escape speed from its gravity is equal to speed of light. Gravity gets stronger as something gets bigger or more massive. For a small thing, like a rocket, to escape from a larger thing, like Earth, it has to go upward very fast or it will fall back down. The speed that it must travel upward to get away from Earth's gravity is called escape velocity. Bigger planets (like Jupiter) and stars have stronger gravity than Earth, so the escape velocity is much faster. John Mitchell thought it was possible for something to be so big that the escape velocity would be faster than the speed of light, so even light could not escape. Some scientists thought Mitchell might be right, but others thought that light had no mass and would not be pulled by gravity. His theory was forgotten. A few months later, a German physicist named Karl Schwarzschild calculated that a black hole could exist. In 1930, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar predicted that stars heavier than the sun could collapse when they ran out of hydrogen to burn and died. In 1939, Robert Oppenheimer and H. Snyder calculated that a star would have to be at least three times as massive as the sun to form a black hole. In 1967, John Wheeler gave black holes the name \"black hole\" for the first time. Before that, they were called \"dark stars.\" In 1970, Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose proved that black holes \"must\" exist. Although the black holes are invisible (they cannot be seen), some of the matter that is falling into them is very bright. Formation of black holes. Most black holes are made when a giant star, at least three times bigger than our own Sun, dies. Stars die when they run out of hydrogen or other fuel to burn and start to cool off. A supergiant star's death is called a supernova. Stars are usually in equilibrium, meaning they are making enough energy to push their mass outward against the force of gravity. When the star runs out of energy, gravity takes over. Gravity pulls the center of the star inward very quickly (so quickly that it would have to be repeated several thousand times before it took up a single second), and it collapses into a little ball. The collapse is so fast and violent that it makes a shock wave, and that causes the rest of the star to explode outward. As the gravity pushes the star inward, the pressure in the center of star reaches to such an extreme level that it enables heavier molecules like iron and carbon interact to release nuclear energy. The release of the energy from the star during a very short period of time (about one hour) is with such a high rate that it outshines an entire galaxy. The ball in the center is so dense (a lot of mass in a small space, or volume), that if you could somehow scoop only one teaspoon of material and bring it to Earth, it would sink to the core of the planet. This densely packed ball is called a singularity. Even without a supernova, a black hole will form any time there is a lot of matter in a small space, without enough energy to act against gravity and stop it from collapsing. If super novas are so shiny, why we do not see them often? Actually, there are usually hundreds of years between naked-eye super nova sightings. It is because the period of being a super nova in a star life cycle is only a few hours out of the billions of years in a star's life span. The probability of looking at a star in sky and that being in super nova state is equal to the ratio of an hour over several billion years. It is worth mentioning that all of the heavier materials like carbon, oxygen, all the metals, etc, that make the life on the earth possible and are ingredients of all living creatures, can only form in the extreme pressure at the center of a super nova. So we are all a remnant ash from one exploding star several billion years ago. Appearance of black holes. The singularity in the middle of a black hole cannot be seen, because light cannot escape its gravity. Around the tiny singularity, there is a large area from which no light can escape. The boundary of this area is called the event horizon. The gravity of the black hole gets weaker at a distance. The event horizon is farthest point where it is still strong enough to trap light. The singularity is like the pipe in a sink drain while the event horizon is like the place where the water falls into the singularity. Even farther away, light and matter will be pulled toward the black hole. If a black hole is surrounded by matter, the matter will form an \"accretion disk\" (accretion means \"gathering\"). An accretion disk looks something like the rings of Saturn. The disk is very hot and shoots x-ray radiation into space. Think of this as the water spinning around the hole before it falls in. Most black holes are too far away and small to see the accretion disk and jet, though. The best way to know one is there is by seeing how stars, gas, and other things behave around it. With a black hole nearby, even objects as big as a star move in a different way, and a lot faster than they would if the black hole was not there. Also, if a black hole passes between us and a source of light very far away, the light will become quite distorted, much like a fun-house mirror in a circus, until the black hole moves out of the way. The light can also be magnified, like a magnifying glass, allowing scientists to see things farther away. We cannot actually see black holes; one way of detecting them is to look at the sky when a black hole passes between us and a source of light, the light bends around the black hole creating a mirror image, so when astronomers see patches of sky that are identical, they may have found a black hole. Black holes have also been found in the middle of every major galaxy in the universe. These are called supermassive black holes, and are the biggest black holes of all. They formed when the Universe was very young, and also helped to form all the galaxies. Some black holes are also responsible for making quasars. When astronomers first found quasars, they thought they had found objects close to us, but after using a measuring technique called red shift, they discovered these quasars were actually very far away in the universe. A quasar occurs when a black hole consumes all the gas surrounding it. As the gas gets close to the black hole itself, it heats up from a process called friction, and glows so brightly that this light can be seen on the other side of the Universe. It is often brighter than the whole galaxy the quasar is in. A lot of science fiction writers use black holes in their stories, and many scientists wish to find one relatively close to Earth to study one better. Scientists also think black holes might cause wormholes, theoretical \"portals\" through space.",

Makkah is closed to non-Muslims except some journalists reporting on the Hajj. History.

Muslims believed that God commanded Ibrahim to send his second wife Hajar and her son Ismail there. They found the Zamzam Well which led to people settling nearby, and thus Makkah was born. When Ismail was big enough, he helped his father to build the Kaaba. The kaaba is the place that the muslims pray towards. This is known as the Qibla and this is the only place which muslims can pray towards..",
   "Yellow": "Meaning of yellow. Yellow can represent light and the sun's rays. Yellow is a sign of cowardice. On road signs, yellow means \"warning\" or \"danger\". It is used to mean this because it is easy to see. Some animals, like bees and hornets, also use the color as a warning so that other animals will know to stay away from them. Inkjet printers use yellow ink as one of their three basic colors, along with cyan ink and magenta ink.",
   "Trademark": "A trademark (or trade mark) is a way for a business to help people to know the things the business makes. A trademark is a name, word, phrase, symbol, logo, design, or picture. It can only be used for the thing made by that business. For example, Coca-Cola and Coke are trademark names for a certain drink made by a certain business No other business can use these names. Other businesses can make a drink that is similar, but they have to use a different name for their drink. The Nike company makes sports shoes and clothes. The \"swoosh\" symbol that they use is a trademark, and no other company can use it unless they get permission. Trademarks can also be names or symbols for brands: whole families of products. The \"swoosh\" symbol and the name Coke are trademarks that represent the Nike and Coke brands. Trademark and law. Trademarks are protected by law. The business tells the government of its country that it wants to use a certain trademark for the thing it makes, and then the government says that no one else can use that trademark. This is \"registering\" the trademark. If someone uses the trademark in a wrong way, they might have to pay a fine. In the United States, the governing law for trademarks is the Lanham Act. When people write a word that is a trademark or show a picture or symbol that is a trademark, they should say that it is a trademark. They can write the word \"Trademark\", the abbreviation \"TM\", the symbol \u2122, or the letters \"TM\" inside a circle. When people write or show a trademark that a business has registered with their government, people should say it is a \"registered trademark\" or use the \"\u00ae\" symbol or the abbreviation \"Reg.\" Businesses that do things for people instead of making things are service providers. They can get a service mark instead of a trademark for the things they do. When people write or show a service mark, they can use the service mark symbol: \"\u2120\".",
   "Afghanistan": "Afghanistan (Persian: \u062c\u0645\u0647\u0648\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u06cc \u0627\u0641\u063a\u0627\u0646\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646) is a country located in South Asia. It is bordered by Iran in the west, Pakistan in the south and east, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan in the north, and China in the northeast.. Islam is the main religion. Persian (Dari) and Pashto are the main languages. The population of Afghanistan is divided into many ethnic groups of which Tajik, Pashtun, Hezara, Uzbek and Baloch. Although the name Afghan (in its original meaning) refers to Pashtuns only, but under the constitution of Afghanistan, the word Afghan applies to every citizen of Afghanistan. The name Afghanistan means the \"Land of Afghans\". History. The modern Afghanistan was established in 1747 and in 1919 the king of Afghanistan declared independence for the state (from UK control over Afghan foreign affairs) under the new name \"Afghanistan\". The history of the land does not begin in 1747. Aryan (Indo-European people) tribes settled in the area around 4000 years ago and called their land \"Airiana vaejo\" means the \"Land of Aryans\". This name was mentioned in the Avesta, the old book of their religion, Zoroastrianism. The old Greek writers heard the word and called the land of these Aryan settlers \"Ariana\". By the middle of the sixth century BC, the Persians who were also Aryans included the area within its boundaries and created Persian Empire. Alexander the great conquered Persian Empire by fighting in 330 BC. After him Kushans, Parthians and Sassanians took over. The Sassanians who were also Persians called their empire \"Eranshahr\" which later became Iran means the \"Land of Aryans\". Iran used to be called Persia for a long time by people outside of Iran. Other people took Iran by fighting like the Arabs (7th century), Turks (10th century) and Mongols (13th century). The area which is now known as Afghanistan was then called \"Khorasan\" and it was a prosperous and important province of Iran, as it was the seat of most rulers. The Safavid dynasty (1502-1736) made Shia Islam the religion of their state. Safavids were cruel to Afghans (Pashtuns) who were living in the south eastern parts of Khorasan and their religion was different, it was Sunni Islam. Afghans then revolted and separated Khorasan from Iran in 1747. The country served as a buffer between the British and Russian empires until it won independence from British control in 1919. Wars in Afghanistan. In 1979 Soviet Union attacked and occupied Afghanistan. The occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600,000 to 2 million Afghan civilians and many more refugees. After the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989, a series of civil wars continued. In 1996, Afghanistan was seized by a hardline movement called the Taliban. Taliban were emerged in 1994 and were sponsored by Pakistan. During the Taliban's rule, much of the Afghans experienced restrictions on their freedom and violations of their human rights. The civil wars and Taliban rule left Afghanistan in ruins. Following the September 11 attacks, the United States overthrew the Taliban government for refusing to hand over Osama bin Laden and several al-Qaida members, who were behind these attacks. In December 2004, Hamid Karzai became the first democratically elected president of Afghanistan.",

   "String theory": "String theory is a scientific theory that uses complicated mathematics and physics to try to explain how the universe works. String theory is an attempt to explain these four forces using one single theory (or unified field theory). This may also be a theory that can bring together other physics theories all at once. If the string theory is true, it is one of the few theories that could explain why there is gravity. It explains gravity through quantum mechanics. With traditional physics theories, this was not possible. Main idea. Usually, scientists think of matter as being made of very, very small particles. These particles are so small (we are talking on a scale much smaller than an atom) we cannot observe them to see their shape. Currently, all mathematical formulas assume they are point-like and therefore have no size at all. The main idea behind string theory is that this assumption is wrong, and that these small particles are instead shaped as tiny strings. The theory imagines that these strings are not precise particles (unlike things that are seen and counted). The strings are very small (10-35 m long), yet they seem to behave like regular particles. It explains how other particles and forces behave. Because they are so small their actual shape doesn't matter much when we are doing calculations of bigger objects. Status. It is used as a possible way of explaining how some things work; it is very hard for scientists to prove everything, or answer every question that they can imagine by using just one theory on its own. String Theory is slightly different from most other theories because it could help scientists get closer to explaining everything that they can think of, so many scientists are excited by the ideas that String Theory has to offer. There are two mathematical models that predict the same physical observations of the whole universe. One is \"as large as we think the universe is\", about the 74 billion light years circumference predicted in Weeks' model. The other is much smaller than the Planck Length. Both mathematics are just as good to explain what we can see. The Superstring theory is based on 10 or 11 dimensions. The Bosonic string theory has 26 dimensions. Gravity is the only real force in the theory. It says only four of the ten dimensions can be observed by us, and that the others hint at the other forces that are observed. It does not say that other physics theories are not true, or wrong. String theory has led to advances in the mathematics of folding, knots and Calabi-Yau spaces. Problems. There are many different variations of string theory, and none of them is fully accurate. Often, many of them use only approximations. String theory proponents say this is because the theory is not finished yet. Another problem is that the mathematical laws of string theory also gives lots of different possible solutions. Scientists that believe in string theory work around this problem by picking only the results that match our observations and saying that later we will find why the other ones are not good. Opponents argue that we can't ever know if a theory is true as a whole if we only take the bits that work. This also makes the theory of little use until the issue is solved, because mathematical laws are usually used to predict what will happen in a situation - but string theory cannot yet answer that question, because it needs to be tried first and then scientists can pick the answer that work. Yet another problem is that it says our universe is made of at least 10 dimensions, while we only see four (width, height, depth, time). String theory proponents say some dimensions may not be visible to us, but others doubt there can be 6 or more hidden dimensions, or that we will never be able to access them even if they do exist. String theory does not make predictions that can actually be tested by scientists today or in the near future. Some people say this makes the theory unscientific.",
   "Saturn (planet)": "orbit: 1,429,400,000 km (9.54 AU) from Sun Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun. It is a gas giant, meaning it is mostly made of gas and does not have a solid surface. It is the second largest planet in the Solar System, the largest being Jupiter. The planet was named after the Roman god Saturnus, equivalent to the Greek god Cronos. Saturn's symbol is \u2644 which is the symbol of Saturnus' sickle. Saturn has a very large system of rings made of ice with smaller amounts of rocks and dust. It has 59 moons, plus 3 others that are not confirmed yet as of 2007. The largest is Titan, which is larger than the planet Mercury. Physical features. Saturn is an oblate spheroid, meaning that it is flattened at the poles, and it swells out around its equator. The planet's equatorial diameter is 120,536 km (74,867 mi) whereas its polar diameter (i.e. from the north pole to the south pole) is 108,728 km (67,535 mi); a 9% difference. Its flattened shape is due to its very fast rotation, rotating once every 10.8 Earth hours. Saturn is the only planet in the Solar System that is less dense than water. Even though the planet's core is very dense, it has a gaseous atmosphere, so its average specific density of the planet is 0.69 g/cm\u00b3 (less than water). As a result, if Saturn were placed in a large pool of water, it would float on it. Atmosphere. The outer part of Saturn's atmosphere is made up of 96.7% hydrogen and 3% helium, 0.2% methane and 0.02% of ammonia. There are also very small amounts of acetylene, ethane and phosphine. Saturn's clouds show a banded pattern, similar to the cloud bands seen in Jupiter. Unlike Jupiter, Saturn's clouds are much fainter and the bands are wider at the equator. Saturn's lowest cloud layer is made up of water ice, and is about 10 km thick. The temperature here is quite low, at 250 K (-10\u00b0F, -23\u00b0C). However there are disagreements among scientists about this. The layer above, about 77 km thick, is made up of ammonium hydrosulfide ice (chemical symbol: NH4HS), and above that is a layer of ammonia ice clouds 80 km thick. The highest layer is made up of hydrogen and helium gases, which extends between 200 and 270 km above the water cloud tops. Auroras are also known to form in Saturn in the mesosphere. The temperature at Saturn's cloud tops is extremely low, at 98 K (-283\u00b0F, -175\u00b0C). The temperature in the inner layers are much higher than the outside layers because of the heat produced by Saturn's interior. Saturn's winds are some of the fastest in the Solar System, reaching 500 s (1,800 h, 1,118 mph), much faster than the fastest winds recorded on Earth. Saturn's atmosphere is also known to form oval shaped clouds, similar to the more clearer spots seen in Jupiter. These oval spots are cyclonic storms, identical to cyclones seen on Earth. In 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope detected an enormous white cloud near its equator. Storms like the 1990 storm were known as the \"Great White Spot\", unique Saturnian storms that only exist for a short time and only appear about every 30 earth years, around the time of the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere. Great White Spots were also found in 1876, 1903, 1933, and 1960. If this constant cycle continues, it is predicted that another storm will form in about 2020. The Voyager 1 spacecraft detected a hexagonal cloud pattern near Saturn's north pole at about 78\u00b0N. The Cassini-Huygens probe later confirmed it in 2006. Unlike the north pole, the south pole does not show any hexagonal cloud feature. Interestingly, the Cassini probe discovered a hurricane-like storm locked to the south pole that shows a very clear eyewall. This discovery is notable as no eyewalls have been observed in any other planet in the Solar System other than the Earth. Interior. Saturn's interior is similar to Jupiter's interior. It has a small rocky core at its centre and it is very hot; its temperature reaches 15,000 K (26,540 \u00b0F, 14,730 \u00b0C). It is so hot that it radiates about two and a half times more heat energy into space than the amount of energy Saturn receives from the Sun. The core is about the same size as the Earth's, but more dense. Above it is a thicker layer of metallic hydrogen, about 30,000 km (18,600 mi) deep. Above that layer is a region of liquid hydrogen and helium. The core is heavy, about 9 to 22 times more mass than the Earth's core. Magnetic field. Saturn has a natural magnetic field that is much weaker than Jupiter's. Like the Earth's, Saturn's field is a magnetic dipole. Saturn's field is unique in that it is perfectly symmetrical, unlike any other known planet (ie. the field is exactly in line with the planet's axis). Saturn generates radio waves, but they are too weak to be detected from Earth. The moon Titan orbits in the outer part of Saturn's magnetic field and gives out plasma to the field from the ionised particles in Titan's atmosphere. Rotation and orbit. Saturn's average distance from the Sun is over 1.4 billion km, about 9 times is distance from the Earth to the Sun. It takes 29.5 Earth years for Saturn to orbit around the Sun. This is known as Saturn's \"orbital period\". Saturn takes about 10.8 Earth hours to rotate around its axis. This is known as its \"rotational period\". It is known that its rotational period does not stay the same, therefore, Saturn does not rotate at a constant rate. Its rotational period is determined by the rotation speed of the radio waves released by the planet. The Cassini-Huygens spacecraft discovered that the radio emissions slowed down, thus the rotational period increased. It is unknown what caused the radio waves to slow down. History. Saturn is best known for its clearly visible planetary rings which makes it the most visually remarkable object in the solar system. The rings were first discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610, using his telescope. He did not identify them as rings though, describing them as \"ears\". He stated that Saturn was actually three separate planets that almost touch one another. In 1612, when the rings were facing edge on with the Earth, the rings disappeared, then reappeared again in 1613, further confusing Galileo. In 1655, Christiaan Huygens was the first person who suggested that Saturn was surrounded by rings. He observed Saturn using a much more powerful telescope than Galilei's. He quoted that \"It [Saturn] is surrounded by a thin, flat, ring, nowhere touching, inclined to the ecliptic.\" In 1675, Giovanni Domenico Cassini discovered that the planet's rings were in fact made of smaller ringlets with gaps. The largest ring gap was later named the Cassini Division. In 1859, James Clerk Maxwell showed that the rings cannot be solid, but are made of small particles, each orbiting Saturn on their own, otherwise, it would become unstable or break apart. James Keeler studied the rings using a spectroscope in 1895 which proved Maxwell's theory to be correct. Physical features. The rings range from 6,630 km to 120,700 km above the planet's equator. As proved by Maxwell, even though the rings appear to be solid and unbroken when viewed from above, the rings are made of small particles of rock and ice. The rings are on average up to one kilometre thick and are made of silica rock, iron oxide and ice particles. The smallest particles are only specks of dust while the largest are the size of a house. The largest gaps in the rings are the Cassini Division and the Encke Division, both are visible from the Earth. The Cassini Division is the largest, measuring 4,800 km (2,980 mi) wide. However, when the Voyager spacecrafts visited Saturn in 1980, they discovered that the rings are a complex structure, made out of thousands of thin gaps and ringlets. This structure is thought to arise from the gravitational force of some of Saturn's moons. The tiny moon Pan orbits inside Saturn's rings, creating a gap within the rings. Other ringlets maintain their structure due to the gravitational force of shepherd satellites, such as Prometheus and Pandora. Other gaps form due to the gravitational force of a large moon farther away. The moon Mimas is responsible for clearing away the Cassini gap. Recently, from data received by the Cassini spacecraft, the rings have their own atmosphere, free from the planet's atmosphere. The rings' atmosphere is made of oxygen gas, and it is produced when the Sun's ultraviolet light breaks up the water ice in the rings. Chemical reaction also occurs between the ultraviolet light and the water molecules, creating hydrogen gas. The oxygen and hydrogen atmospheres around the rings are very widely spaced. In addition to the oxygen and hydrogen gases, the rings have an atmosphere made of hydroxide, but it is also very sparse. This compound was detected from Earth by the Hubble Space Telescope. Spokes. The Voyager space probe discovered features shaped like rays, called \"spokes\". They are seen as dark when under sunlight, and appear light when against the unlit side. It is assumed that the spokes are made of microscopic dust particles that are raised above the ring plane. They rotate at the same time with the planet's magnetosphere, therefore, it is assumed that they have a connection with electromagnetism. However, the exact reason explaining why these spokes exist is still unknown. The Cassini probe detected the spokes too, 25 years later. They appear to be seasonal, disappearing during solstice and appearing again during equinox. Moons. Saturn has at least 60 moons, 48 of these have names. Many of the moons are very small: 33 of the 50 moons are less than 10 km in diameter and a further 13 moons are less than 50 km. Seven moons are large enough to be a near perfect sphere caused by their own gravitation. These moons are Titan, Rhea, Iapetus, Dione, Tethys, Enceladus and Mimas. Titan is the largest moon, larger than the planet Mercury, and it is the only moon in the Solar System to have a thick, dense atmosphere. Hyperion and Phoebe are the next largest moons, larger than 200 km in diameter. On Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, in December 2004 and January 2005, lots of nearby photos were taken, thanks to a man-made satellite called the Cassini-Huygens probe. One part of this satellite, known as the Huygens probe, eventually landed on Titan. Exploration. Saturn was first explored by the Pioneer 11 spacecraft on September, 1979. It flew as close as 20,000 km above the planet's cloud tops. It took photographs of the planet and a few of its moons, but were low in resolution. It discovered a new, thin ring called the F ring, and discovered that the dark ring gaps appear bright when viewed towards the Sun, indicating the gaps are not empty of material. The spacecraft meaured the temperature of the moon Titan. On November, 1980, Voyager 1 visited Saturn, and took higher resolution photographs of the planet, rings and moons. Unlike Pioneer 11, the images were good enough to focus on the surface features of the moons. Voyager 1 made a close encounter of Titan, and gained much information about its atmosphere. In August, 1981, Voyager 2 continued to study the planet. Images taken by the space probe indicated that changes were happening to the rings and atmosphere. The Voyager spacecrafts discovered a number of moons orbiting close to Saturn's rings, as well as discovering new ring gaps. On July 1, 2004, the Cassini-Huygens probe entered into orbit around Saturn. Before then, it made a close flyby of Phoebe, taking very high resolution images of its surface and gaining high amounts of data. On December 25, 2004, the Huygens probe separated from the Cassini probe before moving down towards Titan's surface and landed there on January 14, 2005. It landed on a dry surface, but it confirmed that large bodies of liquid exist on the moon. The Cassini probe continued to gain data of Titan and a number of the icy moons. It found evidence that the moon Enceladus had water erupting from its geysers. Cassini also proved in July, 2006 that Titan contained hydrocarbon lakes, located near its north pole. In March, 2007, it discovered a large hydrocarbon lake the size of the Caspian Sea near its north pole. Cassini observed the lightning occurring in Saturn since early 2005. The power of the lightning was measured to be 1000 times more powerful than lightning from the Earth. Astronomers believe that the lightning observed in Saturn is the strongest ever seen. References.

The club are current champions of the league and are reigning champions of Europe. This is because United have just recently won the UEFA Champions League for a third time. They have also won the FA cup 11 times, and the league cup 2 times. History. The club started as Newton Heath (L&YR) F.C. in 1878. All of the team worked at Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway depot at Newton Heath. After nearly closing in 1902, John Henry Davies took over and changed the club's name to Manchester United. Manchester United made Matt Busby their manager after the Second World War. Matt Busby used the youth team to get new players, and this was very successful. The club won the Football League in 1956 and 1957. The success was stopped by the Munich air disaster in 1958. Eight of the club's players died. It was thought that the club might close, but it didn't, and won the football league in 1965 and 1967, and the European Cup in 1968. The club did not do well again until the 1990s and 2000s, when Alex Ferguson became manager. He won the club ten league victories in 21 years, most recently in the 2007-08 season. In 1999, Manchester United became the only team to win the UEFA Champions League, FA Premier League and the FA Cup in the same season. The club had been a Public Limited Company since 1991, and an attempted takeover by Rupert Murdoch had been blocked by the British Government in 1999, but in 2005 Malcolm Glazer completed a hostile takeover of the club. When this happened fans formed FC United of Manchester. When Manchester United sold star player David Beckham in 2003, they began to search for a player to take his place, and the team convinced Sir Alex Ferguson to buy Cristiano Ronaldo. Notable players.

In East Europe, too, in Bulgaria, Romania, Russia etc German is a part of the West Germanic language family (a group of languages that are similar) and is much like English and Dutch. A lot of the vocabulary in German is related to English, although English has a much larger vocabulary, but the grammar is more complicated. German has a system of cases, and when helping verbs are used, the main part of the verb must be moved to the end of the sentence.

Our personal identity is who we are and what things make us up such as occupation, beliefs, personality, self esteem, lifestyle, relation ships, friends, how we look and what we wear. Advertisers use techniques to grab people's attention.For example, to make a burger look tasty in advertising, it may be painted with brown food colouring, sprayed with waterproofing to prevent it from going soggy and sesame seeds may be superglued in place. Advertising will bring new customers and more sales for the business. It can be expensive but can help increase a business's revenue.",

World War I was fought through most of the continent of Europe. The actual fighting that happened during the war was fought amongst many different fronts. The Western Front was where most of the fighting between Germany and the Allies happened. The system of trenches marked the Western Front as the Western Front. There was also a no man's land that broke into this area. Most of the fighting that happened in this area was trench warfare. The Eastern Front was fought in Central and Eastern Europe and was one of the main places where World War I took place. The fighting done on the Eastern Front was not trench warfare like it was on the Western Front, but instead depended on having front lines of soldiers ready to fight the enemy. The other fronts that had a lot of fighting includes the Middle Eastern Front and the Italian Front. The war was ended by the signing of many different treaties, the most important being the Treaty of Versailles. World War I was the first war where tanks, Airplanes, and submarines, or underwater boats (U-boats) were used as common weapons. Causes. On 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, who was heir to the throne in Austria-Hungary, visited Sarajevo with his wife. Because of riots in the city, the archduke's procession decided to leave the city quietly through back roads after making their public appearance. A Serbian nationalist group called The Black Hand had sent five men to assassinate Ferdinand. All five of the men failed to kill the archduke while he passed through the large crowd. The grenades thrown at the car failed to kill him. After failing their mission, the five men decided to give up and go home. One of these men was a Bosnian student name named Gavrilo Princip, who was also part of a group called Young Bosnia. The archduke and his wife were leaving the city when the driver of their car took a wrong turn onto a large street with many people. The cafe Princip was in was on this street, and he went outside and saw the archduke and his wife. He took four shots; two hit the archduke, one hit his wife, and the other hit the car. Both Ferdinand and his wife died shortly after. Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia for the assassination. This quickly led to a full-scale war. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Both country's allies became involved in the war, and most of Europe became involved. Germany v. France and Russia. The reason Germany told France and Russia that they were at war so quickly, was because they thought they could win the war if they attacked first and quickly. They could mobilize very quickly. They had a list of all the men who had to join the army, and where those men had to go, and the times of every train that would carry those men to where they would have to fight. France was doing the same thing, but could not do it as quickly. The Russian army. Russia had a big army, but Germany thought that it would take ten weeks to mobilize and a long time before they could attack the Central Powers. That was not true, because the Russian Army mobilized in ten days. Also, the Russians drove deep into Austria. Britain v. Germany. Although it was friends with France and Russia, Great Britain did not go into the war quickly, but it decided to go to war against Germany when Germany attacked its important friend Belgium to get through to France. Britain had the biggest empire (parts of the world it ruled) and was afraid that Germany would take its and France's colonies and become the most powerful and biggest empire in the world. Britain was also worried about Germany's growing military power because Britain had the most ships (its navy) and a very big army for a long time. The Germans were quickly building ships and putting men in its army and Germany was almost going to become as powerful as Britain. Turkey v. Serbia. Turkey went into the war because it had lost much of its empire before the war and wanted to get it back. It hated Serbia because Serbia became its own country before the war and took many Turkish lands. When Austria went to war against Serbia, Turkey did too. Greece v. Turkey. Greece went into the war because it was an ally to Serbia. Serbia and Greece were free countries before Turkey took them hundreds of years before. Greece and Serbia became free again but a lot of Greek people still lived in Turkish lands which used to belong to Greece. The Greeks especially wanted their old important city of Constantinople back (now called Istanbul) where many Greeks lived and so the Greeks declared war on Turkey. Bulgaria v. Serbia and Greece. Bulgaria, like Greece and Serbia, was owned by Turkey before, got its freedom and took a lot of Turkish land. But when the Bulgarians did a short time before the war, the Serbians and Greeks felt cheated because the Bulgarians got a lot of land which they felt was Greek or Serbian. The Greeks and Serbians took back Bulgarian land and annoyed Bulgaria, which made Bulgaria become friends with their old enemy Turkey. They declared war on Serbia and Greece. This started a war which resulted in death of thousand people. Italy's Betrayal. In 1915, Italy could see that the Germans were losing. So, in order to receive some profit from the German colonies, which would be divided at the end of the war, Italy left Germany and joined the Allied side. But as it received nothing they were interested in another war. Romania's alliances. Romania was on the side of the Central powers until 1916, when they were forced into the war by the Allied powers. Important events in the war. Most people thought it would be a short war. They thought the armies would move around quickly to attack each other, and one would defeat the other without too many people getting killed. They thought the war would be about brave soldiers - they did not know what the war would really be like. Only a few people like Lord Kitchener said that the war would take a long time. Germany's plan. Germany's generals had decided that the best way to defeat France was to go through Belgium using a plan called \"The Schlieffen plan\".This was invented by the Germany Army Chief of Staff, Alfred von Schlieffen.They would then be able to attack the French army the north side and the south side at the same time. The German Army went into Belgium on the 4 August. On the same day, Great Britain started a war on Germany, because Britain was a friend of Belgium. The British had said some time before, in 1839, that they would not let anyone control Belgium, and they kept their promise. Germany's invasion of Belgium. When the Germans got to the Belgian city of Li\u00e8ge, the Belgians fought very hard to stop them from coming into the city. The Germans did finally push the Belgians out of the city, but it had taken longer than the German generals had planned. Then the Germans attacked the north side of the French army. The French and the British moved men up to fight the Germans. They could do this because the Belgians had fought so long at Li\u00e8ge. But the Germans pushed the French and British back, until they were stopped at the river Marne.This was called \"The Miracle of the Marne. Trench warfare. In the fighting, many men had been killed. The new guns the men had fired very quickly. Some had machine guns, that fire so many bullets that the bullets fell like rain. So as not to get killed, the men on both sides took spades and dug holes. The holes joined up into trenches, until the lines of trenches went all the way from Switzerland to the North sea. In front of the trenches, there was barbed wire that cut anyone who tried to climb over it, and mines that blew up anyone who tried to run across the \"no man's land\" that was in between the trenches. In the East, the Russians had attacked the Germans. The Russians pushed back the Germans, but then the Germans defeated the Russians at the Battle of Tannenberg. Christmas. On Christmas day in 1914, many soldiers did not want to fight. They sang Christmas songs to each other. In many places on the Western front, they came out of the trenches and shook hands with each other. Sometimes they played football with each other. In some places, the men didn't want to fight again the next day. The generals were afraid and stopped this. Machine gun warfare. The machine guns and the trenches and mines made it very difficult to attack. The generals didn't remember this, and they still ordered attacks anyway. At the battle of the Somme in 1916 many British men died in a single day. It was one of the bloodiest days in the history of the British army. Often many men died fighting over very small pieces of land. USA v. Germany. The German generals decided to use submarines. These submarines were named U-boats, from the German word Unterseeboot (meaning underwater boat). The U-boats attacked American ships that were carrying food and weapons to Great Britain. The Germans thought that the Americans were helping only the British and not being neutral. \"Neutral\" means that a country is not involved in the war. But then some Americans were killed by the submarines. Because of this, the United States joined the war against Germany and became part of the Allies. Consequences of America joining the war. In the spring of 1918, the German generals decided they had to attack before many American soldiers came to Europe to attack them. The Germans attacked in a new way. They attacked where the Allies were weak, and did not attack the places where the Allies were strong. They pushed the British and French a long way in some places, but each time, the Germans were stopped. Then the Americans began to come to Europe. The British, the French and the Americans together began to push back the Germans. The Germans couldn't stop them. At last, the German generals told their government that the war had to be stopped, because Germany couldn't fight any longer. Germany asked for peace from the Allies, and the war ended on the 11th of November 1918. The First Russian Revolution. In 1917, there was a revolution in Russia. The Czar had to say he would not be Czar any more, and that the people should have power. At first it was thought that Russia would fight harder now that the Tsar was gone. But the Russian people didn't want to fight anymore. They began to hate their new government because it wouldn't stop the war. The Second Russian Revolution. Then, there was an October Revolution, which was a second revolution in Russia led by Communists that followed the ideas of Karl Marx. The leader of the revolution, and of Russia, then, was Vladimir Lenin. The new government asked for peace from the Germans. The Germans and Russians stopped fighting and signed the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. This gave Germany lots of land in eastern Europe and the Baltic. After the War. After the war, the Germans had to agree to the Treaty of Versailles. Germany had to pay $33 billion in reparations. Part of the treaty said the countries of the world should come together to make an international organization to stop wars from happening. This organisation was called the League of Nations. The US Senate didn't agree with this, even though it was the idea of the US president, Woodrow Wilson. Woodrow Wilson tried to tell the American people that they should agree, but the U.S. never joined the League of Nations.",
   "Reading": "Reading is a way of getting information from something that is written. Reading involves recognising the symbols that make up a language. Reading and hearing are the two most common ways to get information. Information gained from reading can include entertainment, especially when reading fiction or humor. Reading by people is mostly done from paper. Stone, or chalk on a blackboard can also be read. Computer displays can be read. Reading can be something that someone does by themself or they can read aloud. This could be to benefit other listeners. It could also be to help your own concentration. \"Proofreading\" is a kind of reading that is done to find mistakes in a piece of writing.",
   "Earthquake": "In an earthquake the ground moves. Earthquakes commonly last for a few seconds. There are big earthquakes and small earthquakes. Big earthquakes can damage buildings and hurt people. When the earth moves in an earthquake, it can cause waves in the ocean. A big wave in the ocean caused by an earthquake is called a \"tsunami\". A tsunami can also hurt people and damage buildings. Earthquake Measuring. The size of an earthquake can be measured. A number is given to an earthquake that shows the size of the earthquake. Methods for turning the size of an earthquake into a number include the Richter scale and the Modified Mercalli scale. Cause of earthquakes. The surface of the Earth is divided into pieces called \"tectonic plates\". These plates move. When the plates rub against each other, they do not move smoothly. When the plates do not move smoothly, earthquakes result. Some parts of the world get more earthquakes than other parts. The parts of the earth that get most earthquakes are near the edges of these plates. Earthquakes send sound waves through the earth. Places many kilometers from the edge of the plates can receive these earthquake waves. Earthquake-proofing. Some countries, such as Japan or parts of a country like California in the United States, have a lot of earthquakes. In these places it is a good practice to build houses and other buildings so they will not collapse when there is an earthquake. This is called seismic design or \"earthquake-proofing\". For many years earthquakes have occurred. That is why there are earthquake proof buildings. The ability of a building to withstand the stress of an earthquake depends upon its type of construction, shape, mass distribution, and rigidity. Different combinations are used. Different shapes of buildings such as square, rectangular, and shell buildings can withstand earthquakes much better than skyscrapers. To reduce stress, a building's ground floor can be supported by extremely rigid, hollow columns, while the rest of the building is supported by flexible columns located inside the hollow columns. A different method is to use rollers or rubber pads to separate the base columns from the ground, allowing the columns to shake parallel during an earthquake. To help prevent a roof from collapsing you can make your roof out of light-weight materials. Outdoor walls can be made with stronger and more reinforced materials such as steel or reinforced concrete. During an earthquake flexible windows may help that can hold the windows together so they don\u2019t break.",
   "Hamburg": "Hamburg or in full Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg (), is a city in the north of Germany on the banks of the River Elbe, 180 km away from the North Sea. With a population of about 1.73 million (1730000) it is the biggest German city after Berlin and the sixth largest city of the European Union. The religion is about 37 % Protestant, 10 % Catholic, 8 % Muslim, 38 % agnostic, 2% Pagan. The area of Hamburg is. Since it was an important member of the Hanseatic League, the city's official name still includes \"Hansestadt\" (Hanseatic city). Other German cities that do the same today are: L\u00fcbeck, Rostock, Wismar, Stralsund, Bremen, Greifswald and Demmin. The membership in this trade alliance has influenced the architecture of the city to a great extent. It has also left some marks in the region around the city. Economy. Hamburg's harbour is, by shipments, the second largest harbour in Europe and among the ten largest in the world. It is a very important gate to the countries along the Baltic Sea and Eastern Europe. The company Airbus has an assembly plant for large civil aircrafts in Hamburg. 30,000 people are employed in Hamburg's aircraft industries. There are only two other locations world-wide in this scale, Seattle in the United States and Toulouse in France. About half of Germany's nation-wide newspapers and magazines are made in Hamburg. Germany's most-viewed television news \"Tagesschau\" is broadcast from Hamburg.",
   "North America": "North America is a continent in the Northern half of Earth, located to the east of the Pacific Ocean, the West of the Atlantic Ocean, the South of the Arctic Ocean, and the North of South America. It is the north part of the Americas. All of the countries and islands in the Caribbean are also part of North America.",
   "Animal": "Animals are living things. Animals are not plants so they can't make their own food or energy by themselves. Animals have to eat other living things (animals, plants, fungi, etc.) to get energy to live. Many animals live in this world. Some are big and some are small. Some live in water, others live on the ground and some animals can fly. Being able to move from one place to another is another distinctive characteristic of an animal. Some animals eat only plants; they are called herbivores. Other animals eat only meat and are called carnivores. Animals that eat both plants and meat are called omnivores. Animals are divided into groups; see animalia. Their mode of nutrition is known as heterotrophic nutrition because they eat other living organisms as food in order to survive. There are animals living in solitary and groups. Examples of animals living in solitary are tigers, rhinoceros, cheetahs and more. Examples of animals living in groups are coyotes, bees, monkeys and more. Animals living in solitary do not have to share food with each other. Animals living in groups have better protection against becoming the prey of others. Bees and ants are grouped in a special group called a colony. In a colony, the animals work together in a special way and usually have a leader. The leader of the bees is called the Queen Bee. The animal kingdom is very diverse. There are many types of animals. But, the common animals you know are only about 3% of the animal kingdom. There are many other animals, such as insects and sponges! Animals can mainly be divided into two main groups, the invertebrates, and the vertebrates. The vertebrates are animals with a backbone, or spine, and the invertebrates without. Invertebrastes include insects, crustaceans, molluscs, corals, worms, and much more. The vertebrates are divided into 5 groups, fish, birds, amphibians, reptiles and mammals.",
   "Paradox": "A paradox is a sentence in logic that cannot be true but also cannot be false. Many famous problems of this kind exist. One of most famous paradoxes is called the liar's paradox. It is the simple sentence \"This sentence is a lie.\" If the sentence is true, then it is a lie, as it says. But if it is a lie, how can it be true? A lie cannot also be the truth. So the sentence being true makes it a lie. If the sentence is a lie, then it is not as it says, it is true. But that is just what the sentence says. So that makes it true. So the sentence being a lie makes it true. This paradox is not just true in English but in any language powerful enough for a sentence to make a claim about itself. This is true of mathematics as well. Paradox can never be removed from any symbol system that makes claims about itself. Another example is the statement that there is no cabal. Only a cabal can know if there is no cabal, so this is either a guess, or, it is a cabal trying to pretend it does not exist. A paradox can also arise in ethics. Taking power over others is often also required to protect them, but also, one of the things being protected is their ability to do as they please, which this power interferes with. There is another article on ethical dilemma which means \"a paradox arising in ethics\". Because a paradox forces us to think \"out of the box\", about possibilities other than true or false in logic, right or wrong in morality, it is considered very important in education. People who do not see a paradox where others do, are likely to be too certain they are right.",
   "Wimbledon F.C.": "Wimbledon Football Club was an English football club. The club began in Wimbledon in 1889. In 2002 it moved to Milton Keynes and it 2004 it changed its name to Milton Keynes Dons F.C. Many football fans in Wimbledon did not agree with the move. They decided to start a new club there, which is called AFC Wimbledon. The club played in the English Football League and won the FA Cup in 1988. It was a professional football club, which means that the players get paid to play. First move: out of Wimbledon. Also in 1992, the club decided that its ground at Plough Lane was too small and moved away from Wimbledon to Selhurst Park in Croydon. This ground is owned by Crystal Palace F.C.. They stayed there for the next 12 years. Second move: out of London, to Milton Keynes. In 2002, the club's owners decided that they wanted to move the club out of London. Nobody really knows why they wanted to move. They said that there were too many clubs in London, that not enough people were coming to watch the matches. This meant that they didn't collect enough money at the gate to pay everyone and that is why they could not afford to stay. They looked at Cardiff and Dublin before deciding to move to Milton Keynes. Milton Keynes is a new city that is 45 miles (or 75 kilometres) north of London. When they said what they wanted to do, most of their fans stopped paying to see matches, which meant that they had even less money to pay everyone. Before the move could happen, they had to get permission from the Football Association (the FA). The FA is the association of all the football clubs in England. The clubs elect a Committee to decide what to do about things. Most things they have to decide are easy but this was not easy to decide. Or maybe they knew what to decide but didn't want to be the ones to decide it. So they asked three clever men to study the problem and tell them what would be best to do. These three men said that the club should be allowed to move. Some members of the Committee did not like this decision and tried to stop it. But the owners of Wimbledon F.C. said that they would get a judge to decide (in a court) if anyone tried to stop them. It costs a lot of money to go to court and whoever loses has to pay for everybody. The other clubs would not agree to pay if this happened, so the FA had to agree to the move. But it was already too late for the owners of Wimbledon F.C. They had no money left. They had borrowed money from the bank to keep going but now the bank wanted its money back. When you can't pay back what you borrow, this is called \"going bankrupt\" and that is what happened. Luckily (or unluckily, depends on your point of view), the group in Milton Keynes that first wanted them to come, still wanted them. So this group paid back some of the money and in 2003, the club moved to Milton Keynes. They began playing in the National Hockey Stadium, beside Milton Keynes Central railway station and stayed there for two years until their new stadium was ready (2007). Many football fans around England did not like the idea that a club could move. They believe that a club belongs to a town and it is not like a furniture shop that closes down in one town and opens in another town. Another reason that they didn't like it is that they would love to see their own club get into the Football League. The only way that they can do that is if they win their regional league, then win the Conference. So they felt that Milton Keynes was \"jumping the queue\" to get into the League. Because of this, many fans refused to attend (\"boycotted\") any games they played Milton Keynes. In 2004, the new owners changed the name to 'Milton Keynes Dons F.C.', but many In 2006, the Football Fans Federation proposed a way forward. The most important thing for the town of Wimbledon was the trophies (cups, shields) that the club had won when it was called Wimbledon F.C. The agreement was that Milton Keynes Dons F.C. would give these trophies to Merton Borough Council, which is the local government area that contains Wimbledon. The league history of Milton Keynes Dons F.C. would start from 2004 when they changed their name. The Fans Federation would ask fans to end the boycott. Everybody agreed and this is what has happened.",
   "Turkey": "Turkey (Turkish: \"T\u00fcrkiye\" \"also known as Anatolia\") is a country in both Europe and Asia. The area of Turkey is about 780,000 square kilometres. Its population is about 71 million. Turkey's official language is Turkish. Turkey is a republic. There are 81 cities in Turkey. The Turkish money is New Turkish Lira (\"Yeni T\u00fcrk Liras\u0131\" or YTL). The capital city is Ankara, a city in the central Anatolia. The cultural and economic center is Istanbul. In the past Istanbul was known as Constantinople. Turkey was founded in 1923 by Atat\u00fcrk after the war of independence (\"Kurtulu\u015f Sava\u015f\u0131\"). Before that, Turkish Republic was part of the Ottoman Empire. Atat\u00fcrk made many changes that made Turkey more modern. Because of its place, in history the land has been home to many civilizations, like the Hittites and the Byzantine Roman Empire. Many important events in the history of Christianity happened in Turkey. Modern Turkey has a strong economy. It has 7th largest army (4th largest ground army) in the world. Its warm climate lets many kinds of food crops grow, and livestock and forestry are important industries. Turkey is one of the countries in the world that can make enough food to feed itself. There is a strong manufacturing sector making airplanes, electronics, cars, clothing and textiles for home and for other countries. These days, Turkey is a popular place for tourists to visit. It has hundreds of kilometres of beautiful beaches on its Aegean and Mediterranean coasts, and many important historical places. Religion. About 99% of Turkey's people are Muslim. Many are Sunni Muslims, and some are Alevi Muslims (which is part of Shi'a Islam). There are also a few Christian and Jewish people living in Turkey. Turkey is a secular country, meaning it is not religious, and the government does not present a religion. Everyone has the right to practice their religion freely in the country, however there are some restrictions. People are not allowed to wear the Muslim headscarf in schools or important buildings. European Union. Turkey wants to join the European Union (EU). The EU says that before Turkey can join, it must resolve its human rights issues first, and also bring its economical and political system to equal that of the EU. But some say that the reason that Turkey was denied membership was because of its 99% muslim majority. Economy. The economy of Turkey develops every year.Turkey is a member of OECD and G-20. Export. Turkey`s exports amounted to 73.5 billion dollars in 2005. In 2007 exports grew to 106 billion dollars. By May 2008 the exports of the previous year had reached more than 110 billion dollars. Language. The sole official language in Turkey is Turkish. It belongs to the Turkic language group, which also includes many other languages spoken across Asia, such as Azerbaijani and Tatar. In Turkey there are also minorities who speak languages such as Kurdish, Armenian, Greek or Ladino, to name just a few. Turkish lira. The national currency of Turkey is the New Turkish lira, but on January 1, 2009 the word \"new\" will be deleted from the name of the currency. 1 Dollar = 1.18 New Turkish Liras (16 August 2008) 1 Euro = 1.73 New Turkish Liras (16 August 2008) 1 Pound = 2.21 New Turkish Liras (16 August 2008)",

   "Hawaii (island)": "The Island of Hawai'i is the largest of the U.S. Hawaiian Islands, and the southern. The island is built from seven separate shield volcanoes that erupted more or less one at a time, one partly covering the other. The later volcanoes mostly buried two of the earlier ones. These are (from oldest to youngest): Kohala (extinct), Ninole (extinct, mostly buried), Mauna Kea (extinct or dormant?), Hualalai (dormant), Mauna Loa (active), Kulani (extinct, mostly buried), and Kilauea (very active). The largest city on the island is Hilo. It is on the rainy east side of the island. The city of Kailua-Kona is on the dry west side of Hawaii, and is popular with tourists. Called locally the \"Big Island,\" its area is 4,038 sq. miles (10 458 square kilometers). The widest part of the island is 93 miles (150 km) across. The Big Island makes up more than half (~62%) of the total land area of the State of Hawaii and is governed under the County of Hawaii.",
   "Atlantic Ocean": "The Atlantic Ocean is the body of water bordered Scientists say that millions of years ago, there was only one ocean, and that most of the land in the world was joined together over where the Atlantic Ocean is now. Eventually, they think an enormous crack developed in the ground due to volcanic forces, and that the continents started ever so slowly drifting away from each other. The crack would have filled with water from rivers, and eventually the sea might have broken through from the north and the south. Even to this day, the east coast of the Americas is shaped somewhat like west coast of Africa, but the difference is actually much greater than it might appear, so it is not really an exact fit or even a close one. The Atlantic Ocean is still growing now, because of sea-floor spreading from the mid-Atlantic Ridge, while the Pacific Ocean is said to be shrinking because the sea floor is folding under itself. Gulf Stream. The Atlantic Ocean has important ocean currents. One of these, called the Gulf Stream, flows across the North Atlantic. Water gets heated by the sun in the Caribbean Sea and then moves northwest toward the North Pole. This makes France, Ireland, Britain, Iceland, and Norway in Europe much warmer in winter than Newfoundland and Nova Scotia in Canada. Without the Gulf Stream, the climates of northeast Canada and northwest Europe might be the same, because these places are about the same distance from the North Pole. There are currents in the South Atlantic too, but the shape of this sea means that it has less effect on South Africa.",
   "Oceania": "Oceania is a name used in geography for the continent made up by Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, and several other island nations in the surrounding area. Some people call this part of the world Australasia instead. Sometimes, people use the name Oceania to include only the Polynesian and Melanesian islands in the Pacific Ocean, as separate from \"Australasia\".",
   "Cosmology": "Cosmology is the study of \"all that is\". It is part of both physics and religion, which sometimes compete to explain the same things. Some think that because the creatures creating all the models of our universe and ethical traditions and ideas of divine beings are studied in biology, that cosmology also should be really a part of biology. However, the dominant idea of scientific cosmology is the mechanistic paradigm which says that there is either an expanding universe or finite universe, and that the laws of physics are predictable in either, due to the geometry it \"obeys\". It cannot decide to violate these laws, as a living thing might do. Other laws might be possible, but we cannot know about that. In this paradigm, relativity is one of the most important ideas, and models of our universe are not allowed to vary much. However, this view cannot also explain quantum mechanics. Nor does it take into account cognitive limits which human science says can be important. So some newer theories prefer to say that cosmology is something biological creatures need or want to make our universe seem simpler and more predictable than it really might be. It might be for instance that since we think we can control and predict the machines we create, like clocks, we prefer a controlled and predictable model of the environment we live in. But some think that this is like saying that what is needed to explain a city is good enough to understand ecology in general. A related question is how limited mathematics might be as a way to explain reality. If it is very general and really similar for all beings we can say \"we understand reality\" with it. But if it is very different for aliens or whales then we cannot say this - it would be arrogant to assume it until we do math with other beings. For this reason, most SETI signals are sent out with basic math like the Fibonacci sequence and the prime numbers, to see if other beings have the same ideas about these as we do - and can answer us back the same way. Many peoples have their own cosmology that today scientists and most religions do not accept. For instance in Renaissance Europe there were thought to be crystal spheres that rotated - with all the stars on one, and each planet on its own. These circled the Earth. In Ancient Egypt there was a female sky-goddess who arched over the world, which was a male god. And in other traditions, the world was a giant sea-turtle floating in a giant ocean. These ideas were good enough to explain an island or watershed or continent that people lived on. Since they did not travel much, this was a \"good enough\" way to explain the world they actually lived in every day. Comparing various creation myths and world views from all over the world is part of anthropology. This is today considered separate from the astrophysics and astronomy that provide statistics for physics to explain. But the cosmology that a physicist produces is still considered a sort of creation myth, and scientists have no special status when these are debated in religion. Worldwide, most people believe that a divine being, or Creator, was or is still creating universe. They see the ethics of that divinity, not the physics created by humans, at the core of reality. (citation needed) One compromise is the fecund universes theory. In that theory, the multiverse is alive and growing, and creating \"new universes\" all the time. Humans are limited and can only see one of them and guess about others. Models of our universe help to suggest what those others might be like. But, we cannot be sure that laws of physics really vary as we think they might in a different universe. And, most important, there is no thinking or ethics or divine being necessarily involved in this continuous creation - it goes on splitting just like bacteria. This will not seem very special or divine to most people, but, it is compatible with all of the scientific data that we have so far. \"See also:\" string theory",
   "Headrest": "A headrest is something which supports the head. It is usually a suitably shaped part of the back of a chair or of a front seat in a car. It is designed to support passenger's shoulder part and neck to prevent whiplash in cases of crash at the rear.",
   "Table": "A table is a piece of furniture with a flat top supported by one or more legs. We put things on a table, often for a short time, for example food and knives and forks, etc. at a meal, cups for drinks, a book, a map, writing paper when writing, and things for hobbies. We also put things on tables for a longer time, for example a TV, computer or decorations (pretty things). Often we put a cloth on the table, flat on the top. There are traditional ways of putting the cloth, knives and forks and food on the table for meals. We can make some tables bigger, for example by pulling the top out. We can also fold some tables to transport them better, for example for camping. There are also small tables in trains and planes which we can fold or open. Some round tables come with a Lazy Susan. This is a rotating piece of wood in the center of the table. Traditionally, tables in Japan, \"chabudai\", are low, sometimes round tables, for tea and food. The name of the international organization Mensa is from the Latin word for table.",
   "Movement": "Movement, or motion, is the state of changing something's position--that is, changing where something is. A flying bird or a walking person are moving, because they change where they are from one place to another. There are many kinds of science and math related to movement. For example, thanks to Albert Einstein, we know that all \"position\" is relative. This means that everything's position depends on where they exist in relation to other things. For example, a ball is 5 feet away from a box, 3 feet away from a chair, and a foot away from a table. According to Einstein, the ball's position means how far the ball is from other things, so by telling you how far the ball was from other things, I told you its position. An object's \"movement\" is also relative. Its movement depends on where it is in relation to other things and where it's going to in relation to other things. There are many things involved in movement, such as speed, velocity, acceleration, gravity, magnetic attraction and repulsion, friction, and inertia. Also, work is needed to produce movement.",
   "Inuit": "The Inuit are one of many groups of First Nations who live in very cold places of northern Canada, Greenland, and Alaska. They are sometimes called \"Eskimos\", a word which likely comes from the Algonquin language and may mean \"eater of raw meat\". The Inuit generally prefer not to be called \"Eskimos\" but it is a name that was given to them by others, not a name they gave themselves. \"Inuit\" means more than one, one person is an \"Inuk\". The native Greenlanders are related to the Inuit. The Inuit used to hunt seals. They also traded fur with the Europeans. They once lived in houses made of snow called igloos. The knowledge of how to construct an igloo was passed down from generation to generation. The language of the Inuit is Inuktitut, and it is one of the official languages of Nunavut and of the Northwest Territories in Canada.",
   "Financial capital": "Financial capital is a form of capital. It is things that have value, but do not do anything by themselves. They are only valuable because people value (want) them. For example, money is a form of financial capital. You cannot do anything with money but it still has value. Financial capital is used to pay for things, this is because there is always more of it and people always want it. This means that financial capital has a stable value and can be traded in most places and with most people. Some forms of financial capital, such as stocks, gold or bonds are not wanted by everybody. However they can be traded with people for money or another type of financial capital. Because of this, these forms of financial capital do not have a stable price. This means that some people try to make a profit by buying and selling these types of financial capital in a market. Some things are treated as financial capital, even though they do have a use. For example, some people buy and sell land but are not interested in doing anything with it. Some people think this sort of trade is bad because the land should be used and not just treated like money. Other types of capital, such as social capital and human capital are rarely treated like financial capital. This may be because they involve people. Treating useful capital like financial capital is called comodification. In politics, a common question is how often the government should use financial capital. In particular, should the government use financial capital to make a profit? Traditionally, liberal politicians do not mind this kind of trading for profit, but socialist or conservative politicians are against it.",
   "Freedom of speech": "Freedom of speech is the right to state one's opinions and ideas without being stopped or punished. Sometimes this is also called Freedom of expression. Most people think freedom of speech is necessary for a democratic government. In countries without free speech, people might be afraid to say what they think. Then, the government does not know what the people want. If it does not know what they want, it cannot respond to their wants. Without free speech, the government does not have to worry as much about doing what the people want. Some people say this is why some governments do not allow free speech: they do not want to be criticised, or they fear there would be revolution if everyone knew everything that was happening in the country. A well-known liberal thinker, John Stuart Mill thinks that freedom of speech is not as important because everyone should have a right to express him or herself, but because the society they live in should have a right to hear that person's ideas. Few countries with \"free speech\" let everything be said. In America, you are not allowed to shout \"fire\" in a crowded theater if there is no fire, because this might cause people to panic. After World War II, Germany banned some Nazi ideas.",
   "Spade": "In gardening, a spade (shovel) is a tool. A spade is a particular kind of shovel made for digging. It has a pointed end and a straight handle. In some countries such as Australia the difference between a spade and a shovel is important. It is hard to move gravel with a spade but a proper shovel can do it. In game, a spade is one of the four shapes on playing cards. It is coloured black and not the one that looks like cross.",
   "Cuba": "Cuba is a country in the Caribbean sea. The country is made up of one big island and many smaller islands. It is near the United States, Mexico, Haiti, Jamaica and the Bahamas. People from Cuba are called Cubans, and they speak Spanish. Cuba has a warm climate, but has many hurricanes every year. The capital city of Cuba is Havana. In Spanish, the capital is called \"La Habana\". Culture. Cuba is famous for its many types of music, especially dance music such as Salsa and Mambo. Because Cubans come from Spain, Africa, South America and North America, Cuban music is special and different. Early history. Before Cuba was conquered by the Spaniards, three tribes lived on the island were the Ta\u00ednos, the Ciboneys, and the Guanajatabeyes. The Ta\u00ednos were the largest and most common of the three tribes. They farmed crops such as beans, corn, squash, and yams. The Ta\u00ednos also slept in hammocks which the Spaniards would introduce to the rest of the world. Then, in 1492, Christopher Columbus arrived in Cuba on his first trip to the Americas. Three years later he claimed the islands for the Spanish. The Spanish began to rule Cuba afterwards. The Spanish brought thousands of slaves from Africa to Cuba to work for them. Most of the native Cubans died because of the new diseases brought by the Spanish and Africans. The Spanish also treated the native Cubans very cruelly and massacred many of them. The Spanish ruled for many years. Cuba became the most important producer of sugar. In the 19th century, Cubans rebelled against the Spanish rulers, but failed until 1898, when the United States went to war with the Spanish and defeated them. Cuba became American for four years afterwards, before it became an independent republic in 1902. Even though Cuba was independent, the Americans still controlled the island by a law called the Platt Amendment. In 1933 the Cubans stopped the Platt Amendment, but the Americans still had a big say in Cuban politics. Americans owned most of Cuba\u2019s businesses. The Americans supported the leader Fulgencio Batista, who was seen by many Cubans as corrupt. Cuban revolution. In 1959, Fidel Castro led a revolution against Fulgencio Batista. Castro took power of Cuba with Che Guevara from Argentina, his brother Raul, and others who fought against Batista. Castro made many changes to Cuba and ended American ownership of Cuban businesses. This made Castro unpopular in America and the United States banned all contact with Cuba. Many Cubans also went to America because of this. In 1961 the Americans helped some of these Cubans to attack Cuba and remove Castro, but they failed. Castro then asked the Soviet Union to help defend them from the Americans, which they did. The Soviet Union put nuclear weapons in Cuba and aimed them at America. American President Kennedy demanded that they be removed or a new war would begin. This was known as the \"Cuban Missile Crisis\". The Soviet Union then removed the missiles. Cuba became a communist led country like the Soviet Union after this. The Soviet Union bought most of Cuba\u2019s sugar for expensive prices. Cuba spent this money on health, education and the army. This made Cuba\u2019s schools and hospitals some of the best in the world, and the army fought in Africa to support black Africans against the white South African army. Cuba also supported groups in South America fighting against the dictators of those countries. However, the Cuban government began to control most of life in Cuba under the communist system. Disagreeing with the Cuban government and Fidel Castro in public was not allowed. Some Cubans did not like this and tried to leave Cuba. Most Cubans who left went to America. Some Cubans who did not like the government and stayed were put in jail. Many groups from around the world protested against Cuba because of this, and demanded that Fidel Castro give up power. In 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed. This meant that Cuba, which had sold most of its products to the Soviet Union, had no money coming into the country. The Americans made the restrictions against contact with Cuba tighter. America said the restrictions on contact would continue unless Fidel Castro gave up power. Cuba became very poor in the 1990s. This became known in Cuba as \u201cThe Special Period\u201d. Because of the disaster, Cuba changed to allow less control by the government, more discussion amongst the people, and private shops and businesses. Cuba also tried to get tourists to visit the island. In the 2000s, tourism to Cuba began to make money for the island again. Though Fidel Castro had remained in power, he had passed all duties to his brother Raul after an illness. Fidel Castro is 80 years old and was one of the longest serving heads of state. In 2008, Ra\u00fal Castro became the official president of Cuba.",
   "Ethnic group": "An ethnic group is a group of people who are considered to be the same in some way. They may all have the same ancestors, speak the same language, or have the same religion. Sometimes almost all of the people in one country are of the same ethnic group, but not always. Often one country may have several different ethnic groups, or the people of one ethnic group may live in several different countries.",
   "Bible": "The Bible is a collection of stories of different authors. The stories were written over a period of about 1200 years. The followers of Judaism, or Christianity consider some of the stories sacred. Islam sees the stories as a valid source of truth. According to Islam, the accounts have been spoiled though, and the Koran gives a better example. There are different versions of the Bible. The differences are about what parts should be included, and which ones are left out. All Christians believe that it contains the word of God. Sometimes different churches disagree over exactly what the Bible means. There are many names for the Bible; some call it \"Holy Scripture\", \"Holy Writ\" or the \"Good Book\". The Bible was written long ago in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek, and translations were made later into Latin and some other languages. Now there are translations in many more languages, for example, English. Today, a complete version of the bible exists in 429 languages. Parts have been translated in 2429 languages. Most bibles can be found in the British Museum in London. Old Testament. In fact the Bible is many books of different kinds collected together. The first part is called the Old Testament or Tanakh. This tells the story of the Israelites and how God chose them to be called \"his people\". This part of the Bible is considered to be holy by Jews as well as Christians. There are a few parts of the Old Testament that Christians disagree about. These parts are called Deuterocanonical by those Churches that accept them as part of the Bible, and Apocrypha by those that do not. New Testament. The second part is called the New Testament, most of which was written first in Greek. Some was probably written in Aramaic first, but the oldest copies known today are in Greek. The main part of this book is the story of Jesus Christ's life. There are four different versions of the story, called Gospels. The New Testament also contains letters by early Christian leaders, especially Saint Paul. The verse in the bible that defines Christianity is, \"For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but live eternally\" The \"Bible\" contains different kinds of books. Some are history, telling the stories of the Jews, or Jesus. Some are collections of wise sayings. Some are God's commands to his people, which he expects them to obey. Some are songs of praise to God. Some are books of \"prophecy\", messages from God that he gave through chosen people called prophets. The \"Bible\" has been translated into over 2000 languages. It can be found in printed, electronic, and audio copies. Many people, not only Christians, love reading the Bible, and some prefer doing it daily. Others spend a lot of their time on in-depth Bible study or meditation on the words. Atheists do not believe God inspired men to write the Bible because of what they say are conflicts with modern science.",
   "Government": "A government is a group of people that has the power to rule in a territory, according to the law. This territory may be a country, a state or province within a country, or a region. History and Theory of Government. The simplest idea of government is those who rule over people and land. This may be as small as a community with some sort of board that looks after the goings on of those who live within it or something a little larger like a village or as big as a continent (like Australia). Those people who rule the land can allow others to own it. It is a deed by government that gives this right in the way that laws describe. Some think they have the right to hold land without government permission. This view is called libertarianism. Others think they can do so together as a group with others if they live in peace, without government. This view is called anarchism. Almost every place on Earth is connected to one and only one government. Places without government are where people follow traditions instead of government rules, small border disputed areas and the continent of Antarctica, because almost no people live there. For every place on Earth there is a government that claims sovereign control over it. The word \"sovereign\" is old and means \"control by a King\" (sovereign). Governments of villages, cities, counties and other communities are also subordinate to the government of the state or province where they exist, and then to that of the country. It is from Kings and feudalism that modern governments and nation-states came. The capital of a country, for instance, is where the King kept his assets. From this we get the modern idea of capital in economics. A government is said to regulate trade as well as to rule over land. Governments also control people and decide things about what morality to accept or punish. In very many countries, there are strict rules about sexual intercourse and drugs that are part of law and offenders are punished for disobeying them. Tax is how government is paid for in most countries. People who buy, sell, import, invest, own a house or land, or earn money are made to pay some of the money to a government. There are many theories of how to organize government better. These are called theories of civics. Because government is run by people who can be greedy, many people think leaders must be elected by some kind of democracy. That way, if government does not act nice, they can be replaced in the next election. Still many countries' governments are not a democracy but other forms in which only a few people have power. There are many theories of how to run a government better, and keep people from hurting each other. These theories are part of politics. No matter how a government is chosen, it must do politics to keep power. There are many ideas about how to settle a dispute without needing force or violence but by talking and trusting. This is part of ethics. When religion convinces people not to fight or rely on government, we say an ethical tradition is at work. Most law comes from traditions like that. The Ten Commandments is one group of laws like that.",
   "Apple": "An apple is a kind of fruit. The apple fruit is sometimes located on the branch of a tree. A ripe apple might also be green, brown or yellow. The shape of an apple is a ball. An apple is about 18 centimeters around. The skin of the apple is thin. Apples are hard fruits. Apples can taste sweet. Apples can taste sour. Apples have seeds in the middle. People first grew apple trees in Central Asia. Apples are now grown in most of the cooler parts of the world. Sometimes apples are eaten after they are cooked. Often apples are eaten uncooked. Apples can also be made into drinks. Apple juice and apple cider are apple drinks. The flesh of the fruit is firm with a taste anywhere from sour to sweet. Apples used for cooking are sour, and need to be cooked with sugar, while other apples are sweet, and do not need cooking. There are some seeds at the core, that can be removed with a tool that removes the core, or by carefully using a knife. The scientific name of the apple tree genus in the Latin language is \"Malus\". Most apples that people grow are of the \"Malus domestica\" species. Most apples are good to eat raw (not cooked), and are also used in many kinds of baked foods, such as apple pie. Apples are cooked until they are soft to make apple sauce. Apples are also made into the drinks apple juice and cider. Usually, cider contains a little alcohol, about as much as beer. The regions of Brittany in France and Cornwall in England are known for their apple ciders. If one wants to grow a certain type of apple it is not possible to do this by planting a seed from the wanted type. The seed will have DNA from the apple that the seeds came from, but it will also have DNA from the apple flower that pollinated the seeds, which may well be a different type. This means that the tree which would grow from planting would be a mixture of two. In order to grown a certain type of apple, a small twig, or 'scion', is cut from the tree that grows the type of apple desired, and then added on to a specially grown stump called a rootstock. The tree that grows will only create apples of the type needed. In the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom there are about 3000 different types of apples. The most common apple type grown in England is the 'Bramley seedling', which is a popular cooking apple. Apple orchards are not as common as they were in the early 1900s, when apples were rarely brought in from other countries. Organisations such as teach people about the importance of rare and local varieties of fruit. 'Apple Day' is celebrated each October 21 in many places. Family. Apples are in the group Maloideae. It is a subfamily of the family \"Rosaceae\". They are in the same subfamily as pears. Its family is the family of rose like plants, and roses are in the family.",
   "Basque Country": "The Basque Country (called Euskal Herria by its inhabitants) is a region in South-West Europe, that is contained within the borders of France and Spain. Description. It is the home of the Basque people. It is located at the western end of the Pyrenees on the Bay of Biscay. Its boundaries are complicated. The greater Basque Country consists of seven districts--four within Spain and three within France. Origins. No one knows when the Basques came to Europe. Many say they have been there since the Neolithic period at the end of the Stone Age, others say even before then. The first notices about the Basque Country are from Roman times. According to evidence, the Basque people already spoke their own language by then. After the fall of Roman Empire, the Basque Country was isolated from the invading Goths. Middle Age. During the Muslim invasion of South Europe, the Basque Country split in two: The Castillian and the Navarran lands. A war with France split the Navarran zone in two. After the Reconquista, the Castillian Basque lands and Navarra became part of the new country: Spain. Since then, Basque people from the Spanish area of the Basque Country has had their own government, and fought to gain the northern part of the Basque Country from France. Now. Today, three of the Basque districts in Spain--Araba, Bizkaia, and Gipuzkoa--form a political unit known as an autonomous community of Spain. This three-district community is called \"Euskadi\" or the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country. It is one of 17 autonomous communities in Spain. The fourth Basque district in Spain--Navarra--is its own separate autonomous Community of Spain. Population. The entire Basque region covers a surface area of 20,664 km2 (square kilometers). The Autonomous Community of Euskadi covers 7,234 km2 (square kilometers). The population of Euskadi is about 2,000,000--about 5% of the total population of Spain. The Basque language and Spanish are spoken there. The capital is Vitoria-Gasteiz.",
   "Platypus": "The platypus (\"Ornithorhynchus anatinus\") is a small mammal of the order \"Monotremata\". It lives in eastern Australia. It spends some time in water, and some time on land. There are only four types of mammals which lay eggs. One is the platypus. The other three egg-laying mammals are kinds of echidnas. A mammal that lays eggs is called a monotreme. The scientific name for a platypus comes from 2 Greek words: \"ornithorhynchus\" which means \"bird nose\" and \"Anatinus\" which means \"duck\". First, scientists gave the name \"platypus\" (flat foot) to its group. But this name was already used for the ambrosia beetle, a beetle which lives in wood. What sort of animal is it? The platypus looks similar to a beaver with a brown, furry body and wide, flat tail. Unlike a beaver, it has webbed feet (joined toes), which are good for swimming. Its nose is large and rubbery. The platypus is sometimes \"duck billed platypus\" because of this nose. It is similar to a duck's bill (mouth). Platypuses can be big or small. The larger platypus live in Tasmania while the smaller ones live in Queensland. Adults can be less than or up to. Its body can be from to long. Its tail can be from to long. Males are about one-third (1/3) larger than females. The male platypus has sharp spines on his legs called \"ankle spurs\" which contain a mild poison. It will not kill humans, but the poison has been known to kill small animals, such as dogs, and cause pain lasting as long as 4 months. The amount of poison increases during the breeding season, but scientists are not sure why this happens. It is probable that the poison increases, to protect the platypus's wife, its offspring, and itself. How platypus live. The platypus sleeps during the day. It moves mostly at night. It is a very good swimmer and spends much of its time in the water. It keeps its eyes shut when swimming, using only its other senses (hearing, feeling etc). The toes on its feet are joined. When it swims, it pushes itself along by moving the front two feet. The tail and back feet help it to turn left or right, but does not make it faster. The platypus eats other animals. It eats worms; insect larvae, which are wormlike insect babies; freshwater shrimp; and yabbies, which are a kind of freshwater crayfish. It digs these animals out of the bottom of the river with its nose, or catches them while swimming. Its nose can sense many things that other animal noses cannot. The platypus can sense electricity from other animals. No other mammal can do this. The platypus can hunt without using its eyes. When on land, the platypus lives in a short, straight, oval holes, like a rabbit burrows. These holes are between and long. It makes these holes in the riverbank a little above the water. It likes them hidden under roots. When a female platypus is pregnant (ready to have babies), the female makes much larger holes, up to long. She blocks the tunnel with earth at several places. At the end of the tunnel, she builds a nest out of reeds (river grass) for her eggs. The platypus lays eggs in its nest. When the babies come out of the eggs after about 10 days, they hold on to the mother. The mother makes milk for the new babies. The platypus does not have nipples, but milk comes through small openings in the skin. The young platypus drinks the milk from the mother's skin while she lies on her back. At 6 weeks the babies have fur and are able to leave the burrow for short trips. After 4 months they no longer need their mother's milk. Where platypus live. The platypus lives in small streams and rivers over a large area of eastern Australia. The map above shows this with dark purple. It has been seen in alpine lakes in Tasmania in the south, and north in Queensland as far as the Cape York Peninsula in tropical rain forest rivers. In the past, platypuses lived in South Australia but they no longer live there. There are platypus on Kangaroo Island, but these were brought to the island in an attempt to save animals people thought might become extinct. There are very few if any platypuses left in most the Murray-Darling Basin. The water there is no good because people used it to grow plants, and cleared the trees from the land. It is strange that the platypus does not live in some healthy rivers. It does live in some less healthy coastal rivers, for example the Maribyrnong River in Victoria. Platypus are difficult to see in the wild. They dislike areas with people, spend most of their time underground or under water, and sleep during the day. At Eungella National Park in Queensland, there are spots on the river with viewing areas where wild platypus can usually be seen each evening. The past and the future. Europeans saw the first platypus in the 18th century. They sent the skin of a dead platypus to Britain, so scientists could study it. At first, the scientists thought the skin was a joke, because they thought no animal could look so strange. They thought an Asian had made it from pieces of different animals. National Geographic magazine had a story on the platypus in 1939. Many people all over the world had never heard of the platypus. The story told how hard it is to raise platypus babies in zoos. (Raising is helping little babies to grow.) Even today, humans have raised only few platypuses. David Fleay at the Healesville Sanctuary in Victoria had the first successful zoo raised platypus in 1946. He nearly did it again in 1972 at the David Fleay Wildlife Park at Burleigh Heads, Queensland, but it died at 50 days. Healesville raised another in 1998 and again in 2000. Taronga Zoo in Sydney bred twins in 2003, and had another birth in 2006. The platypus will probably not die out completely in the near future. Ecologists say that it is \"secure but faces future threat\" (safe now but not in the future) or \"common but vulnerable\" (there are a lot now but they are not safe). They say this because people can make the water unsafe for the platypus. Also, platypus is the name for a music project featuring John Myung, from Dream Theater, Derek Sherinian, former Dream Theater member, Ty Tabor, from King's X, and Rod Morgenstein. Was also a pet in the present day tv show Phinias and Ferb on Disney channel.",
   "Family": "A family is a group of people who must have consanguinity and live together. They share the housework and take care of one another, the member of the family have responsibility for each other. Types of families. Three types of family are: \"nuclear family\", \"single-parent family\" and \"extended family\". A nuclear family is made up of father, mother and one or more children living together. A single-parent family is one where either the mother or father is caring for the children in the family. Extended family means father, mother, children, grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins, nieces and nephews. In most cases in the United States the extended family no longer lives in the same place, but in many countries including China and India, extended families traditionally live together. Divorce and families. Sometimes there is a divorce, and a family is split between the husband and the wife. A judge will decide if and when children live with their mother or father. If the parents re-marry, the children of their new husband or wife are their stepchildren. \"Step-\" can be put before any relation to show it is from another marriage. If there are children in the new marriage, children from a former marriage are called half-brothers or half-sisters, since they are \"half\" related. Families are very different in this day and age!!",
   "This": "This is a demonstrative pronoun used to identify a noun. It describes something that is here or nearby (\"This ball I am holding is red.\" or \"This is my home.\"). A very easy way to tell if someone is using this the right way is if the object that they are talking about can be pointed to. For example, if someone says \"this computer is mine,\" it should be possible to point to the computer. It does not matter if the computer (a noun) is in the room or in a picture.",
   "Being": "The word being means the same as \"person\". Men, women, and children are human beings. Some people write stories or make movies about beings from other planets. Most religions talk about supernatural beings, for example spirits, angels, devils, gods, or God.",
   "Meteor shower": "A meteor shower is when pieces of rock and dust burn in the Earth's atmosphere. Many objects in space cross the Earth's orbit from time to time, such as comets and rocks. When the Earth passes through the dust and pieces left behind by these rocks, they are attracted by the Earth's gravity and eventually burn in the Earth's atmosphere. When a lot of particles enter the atmosphere at the same time, we see a shower-like effect.",
   "Question": "A question is what someone asks, usually when there is something that he or she does not know. In writing, a question mark comes at the end of a question. This is a question mark: ? Types of question. Sometimes a question needs a simple answer \"Yes.\" or \"No.\" Examples of these questions. People may give a short answer. People may give a long answer. It depends on the question.",
   "Library": "A library is a place where many books are kept. Most libraries are public and let people take the books to use in their home. Most libraries let people borrow books for several weeks. Some belong to institutions, for example, companies, churches, schools, and universities. Also a person's bookshelves at home can have many books and be a library. The people who work in libraries are librarians. Other libraries keep famous or rare books. There are a few \"Copyright libraries\" which have a copy of every book which has been written in that country. Some libraries also have other things that people might like, such as magazines, music on CDs, or computers where people can use the Internet. In school they offer software to learn the alphabet and other details. A library is not a bookstore (a store that sells books). Public Libraries. Many places have a public library, where anybody can join if they live in the area. With a library card, people can borrow books and take them home for several weeks. It does not cost money to get a library card at most public libraries. Books, music, and movies are kept on shelves in a special order so they are easy to find. Public libraries have stories and books about lots of things. Many public libraries have books and CDs about learning English. Stories are kept in alphabetical order by the last name of the person who wrote them, the author. Books about other things are often given a special number, that refers to what they are about. They are then put on the shelf in number order. One number system used by many libraries is the Dewey decimal system. Librarians. A librarian is a person who works in a library. Librarians help people find books and information. They can teach people how to find books and use the library.",
   "Teaching": "To teach is to help students to learn new knowledge or skills. To teach someone is to help him or her learn from explanations or experiments. Professors and teachers teach: it is their work (or \"job\"). Parents also teach their children, but parents also do many other things with their children. People have different ideas about the aim of teaching. Some people want to teach so the learner can learn things that make them happy, for example to learn how to do a job they like. Other people think learners should learn something useful for their family, relatives, or community. Some people think teachers should teach people how to obey God. There are many different places where teaching happens. Some people teach very young children in schools called elementary schools. Others teach older children in middle, junior high, and high schools. Some teachers teach adults in colleges, or universities.",
   "Climate": "Climate is the average weather conditions at a particular place over a long period of time. Climate is the long-term predictable state of the atmosphere. It is affected by physical features such as mountains, rivers, positioning of the globe, plateaus, deserts, depressions and much more. The major elements of weather and climate: temperature, air pressure, wind, precipitation, relative humidity, and sunshine. They help people to describe the conditions of weather and climate. The climate of a place is given names such as Temperate, Arid, Cold, Dry, Tundra, Tropical, Equatorial, Mediterranean, Savanna, etc. Subarctic. Regions having a subarctic climate (also called boreal climate) are characterized by long, usually very cold winters, and brief, warm summers. Temperate. Temperate climates have four seasons. Some of the countries which have a temperate climate are: Turkey, and most of the European countries. Arid. Arid climates are hot climates, like deserts. They just have one or two seasons such as: Saudi Arabia and most of the African countries. Tropical. Tropical climates have warm temperature and only two seasons; Wet and Dry Mediterranean. The Mediterranean climate is usually hot and dry in summer, and is cool and wet in winter. Savanna. The savannas' climate is often tropical wet and dry.

   "Language families and languages": "Language families are groups of languages that are related to each other because they come from a common older language. The languages in such a family are similar in their vocabulary or structure. For example, French and Spanish both come from Latin. Latin was spoken a long time ago, and some of the people who spoke it started to speak one way, saying, for example, for good: \"bueno\" while another group started saying \"bon.\" Most words are said a little differently in Spanish and French, so the two are called different languages. Most languages belong to a language family, but some languages do not. These languages are called Language isolates. There also are Constructed languages, like for example Esperanto. Constructed languages are made for different reasons: making a 'world language', for fun, for use in fiction, etc.",
   "Luxembourg": "Luxembourg is a country in Europe. It is a small country. It was one of the first countries in the European Union. The countries next to Luxembourg are Belgium, Germany, and France. Its population is 442,972. Government. Luxembourg is a parliamentary democracy headed by a constitutional monarch. Under the constitution of 1868, executive power is in the hands of the Governor and the cabinet, which consists of several other ministers. Districts, cantons, and communes. Luxembourg is divided into 3 districts, which are further divided into 12 cantons and then 116 communes. Twelve of the communes have city status, of which the city of Luxembourg is the largest. Districts. 1. Diekirch 2. Grevenmacher 3. Luxembourg",
   "Goodness": "Goodness can mean that something is good, or it can mean the amount that something is good. What goodness is has been talked about by philosophers who try to explain what goodness is. In food, goodness is the part that is beneficial.",
   "Virtual community": "A virtual community is a group of people who share an interest or set of views. A virtual community does not exist in any one place in the world. The people in it may come from many different places. Virtual communities communicate (talk) with each other using technology, such as the Internet, telephone calls, and the mail. The most common is the Internet.",
   "Social capital": "Social capital is the willingness of people to help each other. It often replaces money which people would use to buy the same help. Society works best when there is plenty of social capital. The less social capital there is, the more social problems there usually are. If there is no social capital, war and revolution often results. People who have no money and cannot get help from society may have to agree to do things they do not want to do, or force others to do things they do not want to. Organized crime grows in this way, and so do forced labour and slavery. Most ways of measuring social capital have to do with trust - people who trust that favours and help will be available when they need it will favour and help others more. Those who are seen as trying to get a free ride will get much less help. A social climber tries to earn social capital by making friends with those who have it but without actually helping. Some call this kind of person a social parasite. They are very hard to detect, unlike people who cheat or commit fraud. When there are too many of these kinds of people, especially when they are politicians, people begin to mistrust their government. Rather than work with a political party to change law, they may start to look for direct revenge for things. Social capital is a lot like real capital. The more money a person or a society has, the easier it is to do things and the better off people are. The less money, the more difficult things become and the worse people feel.",
   "Book": "A book is a collection of papers held together between two covers to keep the papers inside safe. \"Hardcover\" books have hard covers made of cardboard covered in cloth or leather and are usually sewn together. \"Paperback\" books have covers of stiff paper and are usually glued together. Books can also be read aloud and recorded on tapes and compact discs. These books are called audiobooks. Books can be borrowed from a library or bought from a bookstore. People can make their own books and fill them with family photos, drawings, or their own writing. Some books are empty inside, like a diary, address book, or photo album. Most of the time, the word \"book\" means that the pages inside have words printed or written on them. Books can be about any subject. Some books are written just for children, or for entertainment, while other books are for studying something in school such as math or history. Many books have photographs or drawings. People who cannot read books are called illiterate. Types of books. There are two main kinds of book: fiction and non-fiction. Fiction. These books are about stories that did not happen, and have been imagined by the author. Some books are based on real events from history, but the author has created imaginary characters or dialogue for the events. Non-fiction. Books of non-fiction are about true facts or things that really happened. Some examples are dictionaries, cookbooks, textbooks for learning in school, or a biography (someone's life story). Historical. The first kind of book was a scroll, a long sheet rolled up. The sheet could have been made of papyrus (made by the Egyptians, by weaving the inner stems of the papyrus plant and then hammering them together), or parchment or vellum (very thin animal skin, first used by the ancient Greeks), or the kind of paper we use today (made from plant fibers and pulp, invented by the ancient Chinese). The Romans were the first people to put flat pieces of paper between a cover, which they called a \"codex\". Scrolls and codexes were all written by hand. The Chinese invented \"woodblock printing\", where shapes are carved out of a block of wood, then ink is applied to the carved side, and the block is pressed onto the paper. This way of making books was very slow, and so very few people had these kinds of books. Johannes Gutenberg was the first European to invent the printing press, a machine that can print many pages quickly. With the printing press, books become much easier to make and cost much less money to make, so more people could have books.",

   "Hungary": "Hungary is a country in Central Europe. Its capital city is Budapest. Hungary is slightly bigger than its western neighbor Austria and has about 10 million inhabitants. Other countries that border Hungary are Slovakia, Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia. Hungary's official language is the Hungarian language. It has been a member of the European Union (EU) since 2004. In Hungarian the country is called \"Magyarorsz\u00e1g\" (Hungary) or \"Magyar K\u00f6zt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g\" (Hungarian Republic). Medieval Hungary, 896-1526. The Hungarians established Hungary in 896, after they had arrived there from their previous, Eastern European territories. Prince \u00c1rp\u00e1d was their leader at the time; he also established the first royal house of the country, the \u00c1rp\u00e1d-house. In 1000, after the first king, Saint Stephen had been crowned, the country became a Kingdom. In 1241, the Tatars (Mongols) invaded the country, causing many deaths and damages. In 1301, the \u00c1rp\u00e1d-house died out. Later on, kings from various houses were ruling over Hungary. The greatest of them is Matthias Corvinus, famous for protecting the country against the Ottoman aggression. However, some decades after he had died (1490), the Ottomans defeated the country in the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs (1526). The Kingdom was cut up to three parts: the western and northern areas remained Hungary, the southern region fell under Ottoman rule, and the eastern parts became semi-independent as the Principality of Transylvania. Between 1526-1867. The Kingdom of Hungary became a Habsburg dependency, because an agreement made in Vienna in 1515 said that the Habsburg family would take over the territory of the Jagellion family in Bohemia and Hungary if the line of kings should die out. In 1686, the Ottomans were forced to leave, and the country was reunified. There were many nationalities living in the country at this time; except Hungarians, there were also present the ancestors of modern Slovaks, Serbs, and Romanians. In 1703, Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, a Hungarian nobleman organized a revolution against the Habsburgs, as Hungarians were not satisfied with them. However, his revolution failed in 1711, and he had to go to exile. The next most important event is the \"Hungarian Revolution of 1848\", when the inhabitants of the country mutinied again. The fights were finished in 1849, with Habsburg success. The leaders of the revolution were executed. Austria-Hungary, 1867-1918. The country tried to find the way towards consolidation: in 1867, the two most important Habsburg territory, Austria and Hungary signed a treaty, and they established the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. The now situation was feasible for both sides: the agreement brought massive economic growth. Between the World Wars, 1918-1946. In 1918, the Kingdom was abolished, and a republic was established, as people felt enough of war. This republic was short-lived, and soon the Communists seized power (1919). Their rule was too irresponsible and many people, including the peasants and the intelligentsia, were tortured. The communist had to abandon the country as Romanian troops invaded it. In late 1919, the Hungarian forces, led by Admiral Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, finally occupied the capital, Budapest as well. In response to the communist deeds, they launched the \"White Terror\", in which they persecuted the communists and their supporters. The kingdom was re-eastablished. Horthy was elected as the regent of the country, as the assemly decided not to recall the Habsburgs. Hungary lost the war. According to the Treaty of Trianon (1920), Hungary lost two thirds of its territory. On the majority of these territories, non-Hungarians were living; however, many Hungarians also found themselves outside their country, in the nation state of Romanians or Slovakians. Thus, the main political goal of the governments under Horthy was to revise this treaty, and at least, to regain the Hungarian-inhabited lands. Communist Hungary, 1946-1989. After the fall of Nazi Germany, Soviet troops occupied all of the country. So Hungary gradually became a communist satellite state of the Soviet Union. After 1948, Communist leader M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi established Stalinist rule in the country. He forced collectivization and planned economy. This led to the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Hungary withdrew from the Warsaw Pact. But the Soviets sended in over 150,000 troops and 2,500 tanks. Nearly a quarter of a million people left the country during the brief time that the borders were open in 1956. J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r became leader of the communist party. In 1991 Soviet military presence in Hungary ended and the transition to a market economy began. Republic of Hungary, 1989 onwards. Today, Hungary is a democratic republic. Elections are held in every fourth year. The current president of the country is L\u00e1szl\u00f3 S\u00f3lyom, and the prime Minister is Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny. Demographics. Hungarians make up the largest part of the population but there are also several other ethnic communities. The largest of these are Romas and Germans. Hungarian is the most widely used language in Hungary but of course ethnic communities often use their own languages as well. The majority of Hungarians are not religious, Roman Catholic or Calvinist (in Hungarian 'reform\u00e1tus' - 'Reformed'). Geography. Hungary's highest point is \"K\u00e9kestet\u0151\" (1,014 m; in the northeastern part of Hungary). The River Danube, one of Europe's largest rivers divides Hungary into a western and an eastern part. The region west of the Danube is called Transdanubia (\"Dun\u00e1nt\u00fal\"). Transdanubia has a hilly landscape and many small villages and towns. The large flat area in the eastern part is the Great Plains (\"Alf\u00f6ld\"). Along the Slovakian border there are mountains. Lake Balaton, Central Europe's largest lake can be found in Hungary. This small country has several thermal spas too. Lake H\u00e9v\u00edz is one of the world's largest thermal lakes. Hungary, however is a landlocked country (it has no seacoast). Its biggest cities are Budapest, Debrecen, Miskolc, Szeged, P\u00e9cs, Gy\u0151r and Szolnok. Szolnok is found at the juncture of the Tisza River and the Zagyva River (stream).",
   "London Borough of Wandsworth": "The London Borough of Wandsworth is a London Borough. It is in south west London.",
   "Beaker": "A beaker is a kind of laboratory glassware. A beaker is a cylinder with a lip and a spout (a bend it the rim of the beaker which makes it easier to pour liquids without spilling any). A beaker is usually about the same width as its height. This makes beakers very stable and easy to handle. They may be made of plastic, glass, or borosilicate glass. Some beakers have marks on them to show about how much volume of liquid they hold - these can not be used for exact measurements. Beakers are often used to make solutions and they are probably the most used piece of laboratory glassware.",
   "Computer program": "A computer program is something that tells a computer what to do. Computer programs can be installed onto a computer. A web browser can be used to browse the Internet. An office suite can be used to write documents or spreadsheets. Crackers can secretly use a computer virus to gain access to a user's computer. Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer are examples of computer programs. They are both web browsers, which means that the user can view web pages using them. Adobe Flash is another example of a computer program. It allows the user to create animations or other computer programs. A computer program is stored as a file on the user's hard drive. When the user runs the program, the file is read and the processor reads the data in the file as a list of commands or instructions. The computer then does what the program tells it to do. A computer program is written by a programmer. It is very difficult to write in ones and zeroes, which is what the computer can read, so computer programmers write in a programming language. Once it is written, the programmer uses a compiler to turn it into a language that the computer can understand.",
   "Gravity": "Gravity is a force. It makes things move toward each other. On the Earth, we see that it makes things fall toward the ground. Gravity may be caused by a theoretical particle known as a graviton. We say that things that are pulled by gravity have mass. The larger the masses, the bigger the pull of gravity. The farther apart the things are, the smaller the pull of gravity. On the Earth, we can measure the pull of the Earth's gravity on something as weight. But, the pull of gravity from the Moon is only about 1/6 the pull of gravity from the Earth. So, an object will have the same mass on the Moon as it will on the Earth, but because of the Moon's smaller gravitational pull (that is, its smaller force) the object will weigh less on the Moon. Things that are falling still have mass, but we cannot measure their weight, so we say that they are \"weightless\". Astronauts and spacecraft in outer space can be weightless. They look like they are floating. Really they are falling in an orbit around the Earth. They still have mass, so we still have to push them or pull them to make them go or stop. Astronauts inside spacecraft use their arms and legs to jump or to stop. When astronauts are working outside in space, they use very small rockets to move. Spacecraft use bigger rockets to move. Sir Isaac Newton is said to have discovered gravity when he saw an apple fall from a tree. He wondered what made this happen.",
   "Leather": "Leather is the skin of an animal, used as a material. The skins of cows, pigs, and goats are often used to make leather. Skins of snakes, alligators or crocodiles, and ostriches are sometimes used to make fancier leather. Shoes, bags, clothes, and balls are often made of leather. Sometimes people make leather out of whales, ducks, graffes, and african elephants, but all of these ways of making leather are very simple but also very hard and rare. At one time leather was only created by the drageons of western Europe, but just as the drageons were going extinct one told a blind guy how to make leather. these are pretty good ways to make leather",
   "Television": "A television (also TV, telly or tube) is a device (pool) with a screen that receives broadcast signals and turns them into pictures and sound. The word \"television\" comes from the words \"tele\" (Greek for \"far away\") and \"vision\" (\"seeing\"). History of Television. Usually a TV looks like a box. Older TVs had large wooden frames and sat on the floor like furniture. Newer TVs are much more varied. Some TVs can fit in your hand and run with batteries. Other TVs can take up a whole wall in a house, and may sit on the floor, or be just a large flat screen that can be mounted on the wall. A television can show pictures from many places. At first, everyone used an antenna (or aerial). This would pick up shows from broadcast television stations. A TV station could be many miles away, and still be picked up. TVs can also show movies from VCD and DVD players or VCRs. Cable TV and Satellite TV can provide more programs at once than broadcast can. Video game consoles connect to TVs. Some computers can also use a TV as a monitor. All TVs have screens where the picture is viewed. Before the 1970s these were usually \"black and white\", which made everything look grey. But now almost all TVs show colors. Screens also used to have rounded corners, but now they are usually mostly flat rectangles with straight edges. Before the 1990s, all TV screens had the same shape - they were a little bit wider than they were tall. For example, if a screen was 3 inches tall, it had to be 4 inches wide. Or if the screen was 30 cm tall, it had to be 40 cm wide. Now however, a new shape is becoming more popular. It is a wider rectangle that looks more like the shape of a movie theatre screen. This is called widescreen. If a widescreen set was 30 cm tall, it would be 53 cm wide. For this to work best, TV shows also need to be made in widescreen. Widescreen sets can still be any size, but they have the same widescreen shape. All TVs used to be made with cathode ray tubes. These are like heavy glass jars with one side facing out to form the screen. Today there are also LCD, Plasma, Rear-Projection, and OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) TVs. Those kinds of TVs are better in many ways, but cathode ray tubes still cost less. Many people think that cathode ray tubes still show the best quality pictures, but the other kinds of screens are improving quickly.",
   "Plate": "A plate is a type of dish where food can be placed after being cooked for eating. Sometimes they are called dishes. They may be made out of ceramic, plastic, paper, or styrofoam. A plate is also one of the broken pieces of lithosphere of the Earth. All plates have irregular shapes. They lie and float on the upper mantle. They move very slowly in different directions. Their movement is driven by the convection currents in the magma. A plate can contain both oceanic and continental crusts. Some contain oceanic crust only.",
   "Kilometre": "The kilometre is the common unit of longer distances on Earth. The SI unit is the metre, a kilometre is 1000 metres. It is now used more than the statute mile for road distances, and the nautical mile for sea distances and air distances. It is also spelled kilometer. This spelling is used in American English.",
   "Census": "A census means getting information about every member of a population. Usually used meaning a population of people, but can be used to mean a population of animals. The United States has a census every 10 years, or decade.",
   "India": "India is a country in Asia. The official English name of the country is Republic of India. Some people also call the country Hindustan or Bharat. (The list of the 21 other official names can be found here). India has more than 1.12 billion (1,120,000,000) people, which is more than any other country in the world except China. Excluding the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir, the Republic of India also has a land area of 2,957,429 km\u00b2 (1,183,610 square miles). This includes the states of Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. This means that it is bigger than Argentina but smaller than Australia. It is the seventh (7th) largest sized country in the world in amount of land. India is the largest democracy in the world. The capital of India is New Delhi and India has the third largest army in the world with nuclear weapons. Although India is a growing economy, it has high levels of poverty, illiteracy and malnutrition. India has a higher rate of malnutrition among children under the age of three (46% in year 2007) than any other country in the world. Languages. The languages spoken by the most people in India are English and Hindi. Many people have looked at the diversity of languages and cultures found on the Indian subcontinent. The only other geographical place they found to be more diverse with regards to languages and cultures was the African continent. There are two main language families in India, the Indo-Aryan and the Dravidian languages. About 74% of the people speak an Indo-Arayan language, about 24% speak a Dravidian language. Other languages spoken in India come from the Austro-Asiatic and Tibeto-Burman language families. Hindi is the language in India with the largest number of speakers. It is the official language of the union. English is also used, mostly for business and in the administration. It has the status of a 'subsidiary official language.' The constitution also recognises in particular 21 other languages. For these there are either many people speaking them, or they have been recognised to be very important for Indian culture. The number of dialects in India is as high as 1,652. In the south of India, many people speak Kannada, Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam. In the north, many people speak Chhattisgarhi, Punjabi, Bengali, Gujarati, and Marathi, Oriya, and Bihari. History. The first people in India lived 9000 years ago; these people were the ones who made up the Indus Valley Civilization, which is one of the oldest civilizations on Earth. After that, the Vedic period came. This is the country where two main Classical languages of the world wereborn - Sanskrit and Tamil. Both these languages are more than 3000 years old. In these, Tamil is one of the oldest languages existing in the world. The country founded a religion called Hinduism, which most Indians still follow. Later, a king called Ashoka built an empire called the Maurya dynasty in 300 BC. It made most of South Asia into one unified country. From 180 BC, many other countries invaded India. Even later (100 BC - AD 1100), other Indian dynasties (empires) came, including the Chalukyas, Cholas, Pallavas, and Pandyas. In South India at that time, science, art, and writing were very good and famous. Many dynasties ruled India around the year 1000. Some of these were the Mughal, Vijayanagara, and the Maratha empires. In the 1600s, European countries invaded India, and the British took control of most of India by 1856. In the beginning of the 1900s, millions of people peacefully started to protest (not obey British rule). One of the people who were leading the freedom movement was Mahatma Gandhi, who only used peaceful tactics, including a way called \"ahisma\", which means \"non-violence\". On August 15, 1947, India peacefully got free from the British Empire. India's constitution was founded on January 26, 1950. The first official leader (Prime Minister) of India was Jawaharlal Nehru. After 1947, India has become a powerful country. It is one of the nations that founded the Non-Aligned Movement and the United Nations (when it was being ruled by Britain). It has fought and won many wars, including ones in 1947, 1962, 1965, 1971, and 1999. India has also done nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998, and it is one of the few countries that has a nuclear bomb. Since 1991, India has been one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Government. India is the largest democracy in the world. Its government is divided into three branches: the Legislative (the one that makes the laws, the parliament), the Executive (the government), and the Judiciary (the one that makes sure that the laws are obeyed, the supreme court). The Legislative branch is made up of the Parliament of India, which is located in New Delhi, the capital of India. The parliament of India is divided into two groups: the upper house, Rajya Sabha (Council of States); and the lower house, Lok Sabha (House of People). The Rajya Sabha has 250 members, and the Lok Sabha has 545 members. The Executive branch is made up of the President, Vice President, Prime Minister, and the Council of Ministers. The President of India is elected for five years. The President has the ability to choose the Prime Minister, who has most of the power. The Council of Ministers, such as the Minister of Defence, are helpers to the Prime Minister. The Judicial branch is made up of the courts of India, including the Supreme Court. The Chief Justice of India is the head of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has the power to stop a law being passed by Parliament if it sees that the law is illegal and contradicts (opposes) the Constitution of India. In India, there are also twenty-one High Courts. Indian states. India has twenty-eight states not including the capital New Delhi and seven union territories (which are different from states). Delhi and Goa have state status. Geography and Climate. India is the seventh-largest country in the world. It is the main part of the Indian subcontinent. The countries which are next to India are Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, China, Bhutan, and Nepal. It is also near Sri Lanka, an island country. India is a peninsula, which means that it is surrounded on three sides by water. In the west is the Arabian Sea, in the south is the Indian Ocean, and in the east is the Bay of Bengal. The northern part of India has many mountains. The most famous mountains in India are the Himalayas, which have some of the tallest mountains in the world. There are many rivers in India. The main rivers are the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, the Yamuna, the Godavari, the Kaveri, the Narmada, and the Krishna. It mainly has a tropical climate in the south, which means it can get very hot in summer and cool in winter. The northern part, though, has a cooler climate, called sub-tropical, and even alpine in the region of the mountains. The Himalayas, part of the alpine climate, can get extremely cold. There is very heavy rainfall along the west coast and in the Eastern Himalayan foothills. The west, though, is drier. Because of some of the deserts of India, all of India gets rain for four months of the year called the monsoon. That is so because the deserts attract water-filled winds from the Indian Ocean, which give rain when they come into India. When the monsoon rains come late or not so heavily, droughts (when the land wears out because there is less rain) are possible. Economy. Presently, the economy of the country is growing. The economy of India is the 12th largest in the world with a GDP of $568 billion (U.S.). In terms of PPP (how much that money can buy in India compared to other countries), the economy is fourth largest (worth $3.319 trillion U.S.). The growth rate is 9.0%. However, that is still only $3100 (considering PPP) per person per year. India's economy is diverse. Major industries include automobiles, cement, chemicals, consumer electronics, food processing, machinery, mining, petroleum, pharmaceuticals, steel, transportation equipment, and textiles. However despite economic growth, India suffers from poverty. 27.5% of the population was living below the poverty line in 2004\u20132005. The spread of wealth in India is not equal. 1/4 of the population earns less than $0.40/day. People. There are about 1 billion (1,00,000,000) people living in India. So, India is the second largest country by the amount of people living in it. Experts think that by the year 2030, India will be the first. About 70% of Indians live in farms. The largest cities in India are Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Ahmedabad. India has twenty-three (23) official languages. Altogether, there are 1,625 languages that are spoken in India. The religion Hinduism is followed by 80.1% of India; Islam - 13.3%; Christianity - 2.3%; Sikhism - 1.8%; Buddhism - 1.5%; Jainism - 0.4%; and many others.",
   "Harbor": "Harbour means to shelter or keep safe. A harbor (or harbour) is a place where ships may shelter. A port is also a harbour, but is usually bigger. The port will often contain a water space with wave breakers around the edge, a number of quays or piers where the ships may be moored or tied up and a transport system for taking goods inland. Often railway and road transport will be used. Other ways that goods can be moved are pipeline transport and by using smaller ships on rivers. During the D-Day operations of 1944, two artifical harbours (named mulberry) were built just off the beaches where the invasion was going to happen.",
   "Health": "Health is having \"everything\" we need to be happy. It is not having disease. It is having good food and water. It is having good family and friends. It is having a good spirit. It is having love. It is having a safe place to live. It is learning. It is growing. It is different things for different people. It changes in time for the same person.",
   "Diarrhea": "Diarrhea (say \"dy-a-re-ya\"), also spelled diarrhoea, is feces that are runny or liquid. In a baby it is the most common symptom of malnutrition. This means not eating enough, or well enough. There are many other diseases that cause it. Most are temporary and related to diet - the food you eat. Food safety and hand washing can cut the risk of getting diarrhea. Some causes other than disease are stress and drinking too much alcohol. In developing nations, malnutrition is a common cause of child death. Diarrhea is often treated with aspirin or glucose - these reduce pain and may stop some symptoms for a while. However, if the root cause is malnutrition, it will not save the child's life. Spending money on rehydrating salts, clean water, and more food is wiser, as the first step. The opposite of diarrhea, firm feces are a sign of good digestive health. Many people adopt vegetarian diets with high dietary fibre to prevent diarrhea and other digestive problems.",
   "Saarland": "Saarland is a Bundesland (state) of Germany. It has an area of and 1 065 000 inhabitants (2003). Saarland lies in the south-west of Germany, near the French border near Metz. The capital is Saarbr\u00fccken. History. In 1920, the Treaty of Versailles created Saarland from parts of the Prussian Rhine Province () and the Rhine Palatinate (). The area was put under the control of the League of Nations for 15 years. After a plebiscite (vote) in 1935, Germany got the land back. After World War II the Saarland came under French administration. Saarland was allowed its own government for most things in 1947 but not independent). Germany got the Saarland back in 1957 and it became a Bundesland. Geography. In the south is France, in the north-west Luxembourg and in the north and east is Rhineland-Palatinate.",
   "Flag of the United States": "The flag of the United States of America is a national flag. The flag of the United States has 7 red stripes and 6 white stripes These 13 stripes stand for the 13 original states. The flag also has a \"canton\", a rectangle in the top left corner. The canton has one star for every state. When a new state joins the United States a new flag is made with an extra star. The new flag is first flown on the \"4th of July\", the Independence Day. The last states to join so far the United States were Alaska and Hawaii in 1959. Alaska joined on 3 January 1959, so the new flag with 49 stars was used from 4 July 1959. Hawaii joined on 21 August 1959 so the flag with 50 stars that is used today was not flown until 4 July 1960. The colours in the flag are red white and blue. The colours have no special meaning in the flag, but in the coat of arms white for purity and innocence, red for bravery and strength and blue for watchfulness, perseverance and justice. The flag is also often called stars and stripes.",
   "Legislature": "Legislature is a word that comes from the Latin language, meaning \"those who write the laws.\" The legislature of a state or country is a group of people, each of whom got his or her office either by winning an election or by being appointed, to vote for the best laws. The way a legislature is supposed to work can usually be found in the constitution of that state or country. In many countries, the legislature is called a Parliament or Congress. Sometimes the legislature is made up of two separate houses. This is called a \"bicameral\" legislature. A county, district, city, or other small area also has a council, that makes the rules and laws for its level of government. The way a council works can usually be found in the area's \"charter\".",
   "Aquaculture": "Aquaculture is the farming of fish, shrimp, and algae. Aquaculture supplies fish (such as catfish, salmon, and trout, shrimp, and algae). Aquaculture was developed a long time ago in China and aquaculture supplies for over 20% of all the seafood harvested. However aquaculture is quite a new activity in Canada as it only began in the 1879.",

Their current manager is Gianfranco Zola.",
   "People's Republic of China": "The People's Republic of China (PRC) (Chinese language: Simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd, Traditional Chinese:\u4e2d\u83ef\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u570b) is a communist country in eastern Asia. It was founded by the Communist Party of China on 1 October, 1949. It has the most people of any country in the world (over 1.3 billion people). The capital city is Beijing, and Shanghai is the biggest city. United Kingdom and Portugal returned Hong Kong and Macao back to China in 1997 and 1999 respectively. These two cities remain highly autonomy. The central government is responsible for defense and foreign affairs but not the daily operations for 50 years. PRC claims Taiwan as one of the many provinces. However, PRC does not have control of Taiwan which has a democratic political system and officially known as the Republic of China (Taiwan). History. Chinese civilization has been around since the second millennium B.C.E. as a feudal society. Its land area has mostly looked like that of modern China, except with northern and western edges that varied often. It has been commonly attacked by the northern people, such as Genghis Khan and Kublai Khan. While China achieved many things in the first millennium C.E. and early second millennium C.E., it became an isolationist country in the 15th century C.E. By the Renaissance, European powers started to take over other countries in Asia. While China was never actually taken over, many European countries, such as Britain & French built spheres of influence in China. Since China had cut itself off from the world over the previous few centuries, it had fallen behind other countries in technology, and was helpless to stop this from happening. This had become clear when it lost the Opium Wars to Britain in the 19th century. In 1911, the monarchy was overthrown by Sun Yat-sen, who started a Nationalist government. Over time, Marxist philosophies grew under the Nationalist rule. In 1927, the Chinese Civil War started, which was fought by the Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek and the Communist leaders. Mao Zedong gradually took over the power within the Communist Party whose army was called the \"Red Army.\" At the background, Japan continued to expand their influence and control of north and northeast provinces of China. The Nationalists and Communists joined to fight Japan. The conflict became part of, and led to, World War II. After the war against Japanese, civil war started again. By 1949, the Red Army won. Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalists fled to Taiwan. Mao Zedong has been in power, although for a long period of time he did not have official position in the government, as the leader of China until he died in 1976. During that time, China had bad relations with the Western World. In the late '60s and early '70s, PRC is even more isolated after the Sino-Soviet split. Before Mao died, initial contact with US took place in order to counter the threat from USSR. All though the initial 30 years of governing, the Communist Party, led by Mao Zedong, has eliminated free-thinking in politics, economics and academic aspects. The \"peak\" of all these is known as the Cultural Revolution which is a disaster in human history, not only because millions of people were killed, but also because the traditional value system was destroyed as a result. The Communist Party is still not willing to admit the fault and a lot of criminal actions associated with the Cultural Revolution. After Mao, Deng Xiaoping, as one of the 1st generation Communist Party leaders, took power and launched the \"Change and Open\" Policy. In 1979, because of the overpopulation problem in China, he made the one-child policy, which put a limit on how many children couples can have. In August 2008, China hosted the Summer Olympics for the first time. People and Culture. There are 56 different ethnic groups in China, with Han the majority (92%). The Communist Party of China controls the government. Mandarin Chinese is the main spoken language.",

   "Psychoneuroimmunology": "Psychoneuroimmunology or mind-body medicine is a view of medicine and health. It partly explains healing as a process of regaining balances - not as curing. Disturbing and correcting forces, which may be molecules or hormones, are treated in a more abstract and social way than in most other medicine. Family and other social network connections play a very major role in healing in this view, and are more important than drugs. Much biology supports this view. Some immune system responses cannot be explained unless it is strongly linked to the nervous system, and the senses. Examples are the type of epileptic seizure that can only be triggered by light, or an allergy that goes off if only a few molecules, not even enough to smell, are received into the nose. Also there are cases of people with HIV who have lived a very long time - with almost no functioning immune system - only their positive attitude seems to make them different from those who die. Sometimes the whole system is compared to a symphony orchestra in your body. There are different types of instruments playing, in sections, which are like the different systems in your body. Rhythm and overall level of stress matter much more than how any individual part of the system works. Rest and sleep matter a great deal, just as they would for symphony players. An important difference between this view and other medicine is that someone is not just \"sick\" until they are \"well\", but will go through periods of time feeling sick, and feeling well, as a part of the rhythms starting to work. So a child for instance should not just go to bed and stay there for a period of time, but should be able to get up and do things, even if they have to go back to bed quickly afterward to rest some more. Dr. Esther Sternberg, an expert in this field, believes that the body has its own internal way of restoring its balance and that doctors usually cannot improve these. In 500 BC, she says, it was common to build temples to Asclepius, the god of healing, and they had long sloping ramps to let sick people use them. There were hospital like cells, and healthy food and fresh water was served. Removing day to day stress, getting enough sleep, and music, dreams, exercise, nutrition, prayer, and interaction with others, was all part of the method. Advocates of this approach to healing believe that modern hospitals are making mistakes by isolating the sick unless they are infectious - which is good for others but not necessarily for the sick themselves.",
   "Hair": "Hair is something that grows from the skin of mammals. The hair of non-human animals is usually called fur. Having no hair is called baldness. Humans and some other animals have lost much of their hair through evolution, and some animals, such as the elephant and the whale, have almost none at all. Human hair. In humans, hair grows mostly on the head, and the amount of body hair is different from race to race. Asians and native North Americans have the least amount of body hair, while Caucasians tend to have the most. Hair commonly turns white as people age. History and culture. People have been interested in head hair for hundreds of thousands of years. For both men and women, styling and coloring of hair have been a way to show importance and prestige. Sometimes society makes rules to control the amount of hair, for example by not allowing people to cut their hair or beards. Hair loss. People have about 100,000 strands of hair on their head. About 100 fall out each day, but they usually grow back. Men often lose some of their hair as they grow older. This is known as \"baldness\", and doctors call it \"male pattern baldness\". Its name comes from the fact that hair loss almost always follows the same pattern. It begins by hair falling out first from the front and sides of the head, and thinning from the top of the head, usually until it is all gone. After a while, all that may be left is a fringe of hair running above the ears and around the lower back of the head. Even though it is unusual for women to go bald, many women suffer from thinning hair as they grow old, and the pattern of thinning is the same as it is for men. People have tried to find cures for hair loss for thousands of years. In an effort to get their hair back, men have tried \"cures\" like applying strange lotions or even having their heads packed in chicken manure. It is only in the last decade or so that treatments have been developed which do sometimes work. Some doctors do hair transplants, where they take tiny plugs of hair from areas like the back of the neck and plant them in the bald spots on the head. Some drugs will cause hair to grow, but this hair is very delicate and will fall out in a short time if the drug is stopped.",
   "Link": "A link is a part of a chain. A chain is made of many pieces of metal; each piece is a link. But today people also use the word link in a new way. The World Wide Web on the Internet is made of many different Web pages. The computer software that people use to make these pages (HTML) lets us go to other pages in a very fast and easy way. The person who makes the Web page can tell the computer to show a word or a picture on the Web page as a link. This means that when we click on the link with our computer mouse, the computer will show us the new page we want to see. A lot of links are blue, and look like this, but a link can be any color. Another word for this kind of link is hyperlink.",
   "Combinatorial game theory": "Combinatorial game theory is a mathematical theory of games. It is sometimes called CGT. It is part of general game theory. It came from ideas from the solution to the game of Nim. It also partly came from looking at the oriental game Go. Very few of the games that people play for fun meet these conditions. For example, chess has draws. These combinatorial games can be represented by trees, each vertice of which is the game resulting from a particular move from the game directly below it on the tree. These games can be assigned game values. Finding these game values is of great interests to CG theorists, as is the theoretical concept of game addition. The sum of two games is the game in which each player on her/his turn must move in only one of the two games, leaving the other as it was. Elwyn Berlekamp, John Conway and Richard Guy are the founders of the theory. They worked together in the 1960s. Their published work was called \"Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays\". Definitions. In the theory, there are two players called \"left\" and \"right\". A game is something that allows left and right to make moves to \"other games\". For example, in the game of chess, there is a usual starting setup. One could also, however, think of a chess game after the first move as a different game, with a different setup. So each position is also called a game. Games have the notation. formula_1 are the games the left player can move to. formula_2 are the games the right player can move to. If you know chess notation, then the usual chess setup is the game The dots \"...\" mean there are many moves, so not all are shown. The easiest game of Nim starts with no counters at all! In such a case, neither player can move. That is shown as. Both sides are empty, because neither player can move. The first player to go cannot move, and so will lose. In CGT, people often write as the symbol 0 (zero). The next-easiest game has only one pile, with just one counter. If the left player goes first, that player must take the counter, leaving right with no moves (, or 0). If instead right moves first, there will be no more moves for left. So both left and right can make a move to 0. That is shown as |, or. The first player to move will win. Games equal to are very important. They are written with the symbol, * (star).",
   "Pop music": "Pop music is shorter way of writing \"popular music\". Pop music is commonly defined as music most listened to, purchased, nominated for special events. Styles of pop music in the 2000s (today) include rock music, hip hop, and pop punk. What is pop music? The singers and bands that play pop music on stage at music concerts or in music videos are an important part of pop music. The singers sing the lyrics (words) of the songs and dance on stage. The musicians in the bands play musical instruments such as electric guitar, electric bass guitar, synthesizer keyboards, piano, and drums. How does the business of pop music work? There are also many more people working on pop music who are not seen on the stage or in the video. These people include the studio staff (people who help the musicians to record CDs and music videos in music studios), production staff (people who help make the music recordings sound good), distribution staff (people who help sell the music to stores) and retail staff (people that sell the music to people at CD stores). Tour staff help the band to travel around the country (or around the world) for their concert tours. Some tour staff help by carrying heavy musical instruments onto the stage. Other tour staff drive buses or cars, so that the band can get to the concert. Some tour staff operate sound equipment, such as the large amplifiers and loudspeakers that are used to amplify (make louder) the band's music for the audience. Promotional staff help to market or promote the band's music, so that more people will know about the band, and buy the band's CDs. Some promotional staff travel to radio stations and give the band's CD to radio station managers or DJs (disk jockeys: the people who announce songs on the radio). Other promotional staff write press releases (short articles) about the band which are sent to newspapers. Types of music that became pop music. Pop music came from the Rock and Roll movement of the early 1950s, when record companies recorded songs that they thought that teenagers would like. Pop music usually uses musical styles from the other types of music that are popular at the time. Many different styles of music have become pop music during different time periods. Often, music companies create pop music styles by taking a style of music that only a small number of people were listening to, and then making that music more popular by marketing it to teenagers and young adults. In the 1950s, recording companies took blues-influenced rock and roll (for example Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley) and rockabilly (for example Carl Perkins and Buddy Holly) and promoted them as pop music. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, record companies took folk music bands and musicians and helped them to create a new type of music called folk rock or acid rock. Folk rock and acid rock mixed folk music, blues and rock and roll (for example The Byrds and Janis Joplin). In the 1970s, record companies created several harder, louder type of blues called blues rock or heavy metal, which became a type of pop music (for example the bands Led Zeppelin and Judas Priest). In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a type of nightclub dance music called Disco turned into a popular type of pop music. Record companies took an experimental, strange-sounding type of music called New Wave music from the 1980s and turned it into pop music bands such as \"The Cars.\" In the 1990s record companies took an underground type of hard rock called Grunge (for example the band Nirvana). Controversy: Do pop bands \"Sell out\" their values? Thousands of new pop bands are formed each year around the world. Each band tries to write songs and music that will become a popular new music trend. Record companies promote these bands and songs by sending the songs to radio stations and by making videos of the band. Some music fans say that the bands or musicians who write music that becomes popular (pop music) have \"sold out\" (betrayed) the values (beliefs) of their original fans. In the 1960s, some people who liked folk music said that folk rock musicians had \"sold out\" the values (beliefs) of traditional folk music, because folk rock bands made a lot of money and were controlled by huge recording companies. In the 1990s, some punk rock bands began playing pop punk, which is punk rock mixed with pop music. Some people who like punk rock say that pop punk bands have sold out (betrayed) the rebellious values (beliefs) and political beliefs of punk rock. The Reigning King and Queen of Pop are: Michael Jackson and Madonna, respectively.",

   "Dichlorphenolindophenol": "DCPIP (its full name is \"2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol\") is a blue chemical used as a dye as when it is in its oxidized state it is blue. Information. Once reduced (by addition of electrons) it becomes colourless. This reaction can be reversed, and the colourless DCPIP will turn blue again, when it is oxidized. Purpose. DCPIP is often used to measure the electron transport chain in plants. It has a higher redox potential (electron affinity) than the Fe-S complex in cytochrome b and will therefore \"steal\" electrons from it. This means that cytochrome c does not receive them. The process cuts off the electron supply of photosystem I. A common way to illustrate this change is by the addition of vitamin C solution. This reduces the 'jelly' by transforming it to a colourless mass. This experiment can be carried out to illustrate the affect of changing cell sizes on SA/V (surface area:volume ratio). This is known as Titration.",

   "Adverb": "An adverb is a word used to tell more about a verb, and it almost always answers the questions \"how?\", \"when?\", \"where?\", \"how often?\", and \"in what way?\". Words like \"slowly\", \"loudly\", \"carefully\", \"quickly\", or \"sadly\" are all adverbs. Adverbs usually, but not always, end in \"-ly\". An adverb can also modify (describe) an adjective or another adverb. Adverb modifying a verb: He writes well Adverb modifying another adverb: He writes very well Adverb modifying an adjective: He is very well In the first two examples the word 'well' is an adverb. In the last example, it is an adjective. This is one example in which the same word can be both an adjective and an adverb but not in the same sentence. As a rule, the same word can play different roles but not in the same sentence. It all depends on what the word is doing in the sentence. It could be a noun, an adjective, an adverb, a verb, etc. Example: take the word 'cool'. In the sentence, \"he walks cool\", the word 'cool' is an adverb. In the sentence, \"cool the hot dish\", the word 'cool' is a verb. In the sentence, \"it is a cool evening\", the word 'cool' is an adjective. In the first example, \"he walks cool\", the word 'cool' really means 'coolly' as in \"play it cool\" (don't get excited; be calm). Adverb form. Most adverbs are formed by adding ly to the end of an adjective. To see 100 adjectives used in Basic English, click here --->: adjective",
   "Arithmetic": "Arithmetic is what we call working with numbers. Arithmetic studies numbers zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine. It is a part of mathematics. The four basic arithmetic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Harder arithmetic includes working with signed numbers, fractions, and decimals, and taking powers and roots. Most people learn arithmetic in grade school, but some people do not learn arithmetic and others forget the arithmetic they learned. Many jobs require a knowledge of arithmetic, and many employers complain that it is hard to find people who know enough arithmetic. A few of the many jobs that require arithmetic include carpenters, plumbers, auto mechanics, accountants, doctors, and nurses. Arithmetic is needed in all areas of mathematics, science, and engineering. Calculators are used to do arithmetic, but if a person needs a calculator to do simple arithmetic, like 2 + 2 = 4, then they will be too slow trying to do arithmetic on the job, just as a person who needs to look up the spelling of a word like \"cat\" in the dictionary will be too slow to write on the job. A skilled worker has to have a very good knowledge of arithmetic and the English language in order to earn the right salary.",
   "Height": "Height is the distance between the lowest end and highest end of an object. For example, people consider the bottom of the foot a person's lowest end, and the top of the head a person's highest end. The distance between my lowest end--the bottom of my foot--and my highest end--the top of my head--measures out to 64 inches, so my height measures out to 64 inches too. \"My height is 64 inches.\"",
   "Scarcity": "Scarcity in economics is used to describe the lack of various forms of capital. Scarcity can be used to describe an economic situation in economics, or it can be used to describe more general situations. In economics, scarcity is the result of people having \"Unlimited Wants and Needs,\" or always wanting something new, and having \"Limited Resources.\" Limited Resources means that there are never enough resources, or materials, to satisfy, or fulfill, the wants and needs that every person have. Scarcity is called the \"basic economic problem,\" meaning that is always exists. Scarcity exists due to the effects of nature such as drought, floods, storms, pest infestation, fire and other things. Real scarcity can also exist by over use of non-renewable resources. Goods (things) and services are also scarce because there are only a limited number of things in the world and due to the limits of technology and our own priorities.",
   "Bird": "Birds are a group among the animals called vertebrates or animals with backbones. They form the class \"Aves\". They are warm-blooded and they lay eggs. They are covered with feathers and they have wings. Their bones are hollow. This makes them lighter and allows many of them to fly. Birds have two legs usually covered with scales (small, flat hard plates which over-lap in the same way as feathers). They have a hard beak with no teeth. Because birds have a high temperature and use lots of energy, they need to eat a lot of food, compared with their weight. More than 9000 different species (kinds) of birds are known. Birds are found on every continent of the world. Different types of birds have made \"adaptations\" or changes so it is possible for some birds to live in freezing cold environments while other birds live in hot deserts. Birds can live in forests, in grasslands, on cliff faces, in river banks, on stony sea shores, down mine shafts and in the roofs of houses. Bird are also \"adapted\" to eat different foods. Many birds live on seeds and fruit. Some birds eat green plants. Some birds live on the nectar or honey in flowers. Other birds live on insects. Some birds eat fish. Some eat small reptiles and mice. Birds of prey eat mammals and other birds. Some birds are scavengers and eat the bodies of creatures that have died. Birds come in many sizes from the Bee Hummingbird that is only 60mm long to the ostrich which stands 2.5 metres high. The bird with the widest wingspan is the Wandering Albatross many of which measure 3 metres from tip to tip. Different shapes. Because birds live on every continent and have adapted to all sorts of conditions, different types of birds look very different from each other. The most noticeable differences are the size, the shape of the beak, the length of the legs, the length of the neck and the colour. The smallest types of birds are tiny birds that feed on nectar, honey and insects. The biggest birds are flightless birds with long legs-- ostriches, emus and cassowaries. However, very large birds are also found soaring high in the sky-- eagles, vultures, albatross and pelicans. The way to understand the living habits of a bird is to look at its legs and feet, its beak, its neck and its wings. If a bird has very long legs, then it probably spends most of its time walking, like a crane, or wading (walking in water), like a flamingo. Birds with long legs need long necks to match, so they can reach their food. Birds with short legs and long necks like pelicans, geese and swans are birds that swim well and dive their heads into the water for food. Their beaks are often flat for scooping up water weeds. A pelican's beak can change into a shape like a huge bucket for catching fish. Birds that are shaped like torpedoes are good at diving. Albatross, seagulls and kingfishers all have long strong beaks for catching fish. Some birds, such as eagles, owls vultures and hawks, have beaks which are hooked and very large claws (also called \"talons\") with which they can tear and carry meat. Some birds have very long thin beaks that they use for dipping into flowers or poking into holes in the ground. These include humming birds, bee eaters and avocets. Some birds have short beaks but wide mouths that are perfect for catching insects in the air, like swallows, swifts and nightjars. Some birds that eat fruit, like toucans and hornbills, have beaks which are enormous, but are very light in weight. The curved beaks of parrots are good for eating large seeds and cracking nuts, while birds that peck small seeds and food from the ground have short beaks like pigeons. Different colours. Birds come in a huge range of colours. These colours can be useful to a bird in two ways. The colours can either help to hide the bird, or they can help to attract attention to the bird when it is looking for a mate. Bird Camouflage. Many birds are brown, green or grey. These colours make a bird harder see; they camouflage the bird. Brown is the most common colour. Brown birds include sparrows, emus, thrushes, larks, eagles, falcons and the female birds of many species such as wrens, ducks, blackbirds and peacocks. When a brown bird is in long grass or among tree trunks or rocks, it is \"camouflaged\". Birds that live in long grass often have brown feathers streaked with black which looks like shadows. A Bittern is almost invisible in long reeds. Other birds, including starlings and minahs, are quite dark in colour, but are flecked with little spots that look like raindrops on leaves. Many birds from hot countries are green or have some green feathers, particularly parrots. Birds that live in green trees often have green backs, even if they have bright-coloured breasts. From the back, the birds are \"camouflaged\". This is very useful when sitting on a nest. The bird's bright-coloured breast is hidden. Budgerigiars are bred in different colours such as blue, white and mauve, but in the wild, they are nearly all green and yellow. Even though they fly very well, they normally spend a lot of time on the ground, eating grass seeds. Their yellow and black stiped back helps to hide them in the shadows made by long dry grass, while their green breasts are a similar colour to the leaves of gum trees. Grey birds include most pigeons and doves, cranes, storks and herons. Grey birds are often rock-living birds like pigeons, or birds that sit on dead tree trunks looking like a broken branch. Water birds like herons often have a pale grey colour which makes it harder for a fish to notice that the bird is standing, looking down for something to catch. Water birds, no matter what colour they are on top, are often white underneath, so that when a fish looks up, the bird looks like part of the sky. Black birds include crows, ravens and male blackbirds. Some birds that are dark colours spend quite a lot of time on the ground, hopping around in the shadows under bushes. Among these birds are the male blackbird and the satin bowerbird which is not black but very dark blue. Crows and ravens often perch high on bare trees in the winter, where their black shape against the sky looks like the dark bare branches. Beautiful colours. Many birds are not camouflaged but stand out because they are \"pied\". This means that they are black and white. Black and white birds include magpies, pied geese, pelicans, and Australian magpies (which are not really magpies at all). Pied birds often have brightly coloured beaks and legs of yellow or red. The silver pheasant, with its long white tail striped with fine bars of black, has a brightly coloured face. Some birds are famous for their colour and are named for it, such as the Bluebird, the Azure Kingfisher, the Golden Pheasant, the Scarlet Macaw, the Violet Wren and the Robin Redbreast. Many other birds are very brightly coloured, in countless combinations. Some of the most colourful birds are quite common like pheasants, peacocks, domestic fowl and parrots. Colourful small birds include blue tits, the gold finches, humming birds, fairy wrens and bee eaters (which are also called \"rainbow birds\"). Some birds, like those of the Bird of Paradise in Papua New Guinea have such beautiful feathers that they have been hunted for them. With some birds, such as flamingos, the male and the female are both brightly coloured. With other species, only the male is brightly coloured, and uses his colouful feathers to attract females. The peacock is the best example of this, but also in the domestic fowl, the male has long shiny feathers above his tale and also long neck feathers that may be a different colour to his wings and body. There are only a very few types of birds (like the Eclectus Parrot) where the female is more colourful than the male. How do birds fly? Most birds can fly. They do this by pushing through the air with their wings. The curved surfaces of the wings cause air currents (wind) which lift the bird. Flapping keeps the air current moving to create lift and also moves the bird forward. Some birds can \"glide\" on air currents without flapping. Many birds use this method when they are about to land. Some birds can also \"hover\" and remain in one place. This method is used by birds of prey such as falcons that are looking for something to eat. Seagulls are also good at \"hovering\", particularly if there is a strong breeze. The most expert \"hovering\" birds are tiny hummingbirds which can beat their wings both backwards and forwards and can stay quite still in the air while they dip their long beaks into flowers to feed on the sweet nectar. Types of flight. Different types of birds have different needs. Their wings are \"adapted\" to suit the way they fly. Large birds of prey, such as eagles, that spend a lot of time \"soaring\" on the wind have wings that are large and broad. The main flight feathers are long and wide. They help the eagle to stay on rising \"air currents\" without using much energy, while the eagle looks at the ground below, to find the next meal. When the eagle sees some small creature move, it can close its wings and fall from the sky like a missile, opening its great wings again to slow down as it comes to land. The world's largest eagle, the Philippine Eagle has a wingspan of about 2 metres (6.7 ft) wide. Birds that live in grassland areas or open forests and feed on fruit, insects and reptiles often spend a lot of time flying short journeys looking for food and water. They have wings that are shaped in a similar way to eagles, but rounder and not as good for soaring. These include many Australian birds like Cockatoos. Birds, such as geese, that migrate from one country to another fly very long distances. Their wings are big and strong, because the birds are large and they stock up on food for the long flight. Migrating water birds usually form family groups of 12-30 birds. They fly very high, making use of long streams of air that blow from north to south in different seasons. They are very well organised, often flying in a V pattern. The geese at the back don't have to flap so hard; they are pulled on by the wind of the ones at the front. Every so often, they change the leader so that the front bird, who does most work and sets the pace, can have a rest. Geese and swans are the highest-flying birds, reaching 8,000 metres or more when on migration. Geese often \"honk\" loudly while they are flying. It is thought that they do this to support the leader and help the young ones. Birds that fly very quickly, such as swifts and swallows, have long narrow pointed wings. These birds need great speed because they eat insects, catching most of them while they are flying. These birds also migrate. They often collect in huge flocks of thousands of birds that move together like a whirling cloud. Birds that live in bushes and branches have triangular wings that help the bird change direction. Many forest birds are expert at getting up speed by flapping and then gliding steadily among the trees, tilting to avoid things as they go. Members of the kingfisher family are expert at this type of flying. Birds such as owls that hunt at night have wings with soft rounded feathers so that they don't flap loudly. Birds that are awake at night are called \"nocturnal\" birds. Birds that are awake during the day are \"diurnal\". A Wandering Albatross and Arctic Tern might spend several years without coming to land. They can sleep while gliding and have wings which, when they are stretched right out, look like the wings of a jet plane. Bird like chickens that feed mainly on the ground and only use their wings to fly to safety have small wings. Flightless birds. Some birds do not fly. These include running birds like ostriches and emus and ocean-living birds, the large penguin family. Ostriches and emus do not need to fly because although they feed and nest on the ground, their great size and their speed is their protection. Some other ground-feeding birds have not been so lucky. Some birds such as the Dodo and the Kiwi were ground-feeding birds that lived in safety on islands where there was nothing dangerous to eat them. They lost the power of flight. Kiwis are endangered because European settlement to New Zealand brought animals like cats, dogs and rats which kill kiwis and eat their eggs. However, Kiwis and also the rare New Zealand Ground Parrot have survived. In the case of Dodos, they were fat and delicious. They were killed and eaten by sailors until there was none left. Other flightless birds which have disappeared are the Auk and the Moa. Penguins spend a great deal of time at sea, where they are in danger from seals. On land, they usually live in areas where there were few dangers, until the arrival of European settlers with dogs and cats. Their wings have adapted to life in the sea and have become flippers which help them in swimming very fast. Choosing partners. Although birds are warm-blooded creatures like mammals, they do not give birth to live babies. They lay eggs like cold-blooded creatures such as lizards. Unlike most reptiles, the shell of a bird's egg is hard. The baby bird grows inside the egg and after a few weeks, breaks out, or \"hatches\". Birds in cold climates usually have a \"breeding season\" once a year in the spring. Migratory birds can have two springs and two mating seasons in a year. So can birds that live in hot climates. When the breeding season arrives, the birds choose partners. Some birds are mated for life, like married couples. These birds include pigeons, geese, and cranes. Other birds look for new partners each year and sometimes a male bird or \"cock\" will have several wives. For birds that choose new mates, part of the breeding season is \"display\". The male bird will do all sorts of things to attract females. These include singing, dancing, showing off the feathers and building a beautiful nest. Some male birds have splendid feathers for attracting females. The most famous is the peacock who can spread the feathers above his tale into a huge fan. Nesting. Once the birds have found partners, they find a suitable place to lay eggs. The idea of what is a suitable place differs from one species of bird to another. Most birds make nests of one sort or another but these differ from bird to bird as well. Robins will make a beautiful little round nest of woven grass and carefully line it with feathers, bits of fluff and other soft things. Swallows like to nest near other swallows. They make nests from little blobs of clay, often on a beam near the roof of a building where it is well sheltered. Many birds like a hollow tree to nest in. Eagle's nests are often just piles of dead wood on the top of the tallest tree or mountain. Scrub Turkeys scratch together a huge pile of leaves that may be 10 metres across. Guillemots lay their eggs on rock shelves with no nest at all. Their eggs are shaped so that they roll around in circles. A cuckoo doesn't bother about making its own nest. It lays its egg in the nest of some other bird and leaves it for strangers to care for. When the nest has been prepared, the birds mate so that the eggs are fertilised and the chicks will start growing. Unlike mammals, birds only have one opening as the exit hole for body fluids. The opening is called the cloaca. A female bird, called a \"hen\" has two ovaries, of which the left one usually produces eggs. Most male birds have no sex organs that can be seen. But inside the male are two testes which produce sperm which is stored in the \"cloaca\". Birds mate by rubbing their cloacas together, although with some birds, particularly large water birds, the male has a sort of a penis inside the \"cloaca\". Hatching. Once the \"hen\" has mated, she produces fertile eggs which have chicks growing inside them. She lays the eggs in the nest. There might be just one egg or a number of them, called a \"clutch\". Emus might lay as many as fifteen huge dark green eggs in a clutch. After the eggs are laid, they are incubated\", or kept warm so the chicks form inside. One of the good things about the fact that most birds stay together for the whole nesting time is that the work is shared. The birds generally take turns sitting on the eggs, so that both can feed. This is not always the case. With Emus, the male does all the \"sitting\" and all the baby-minding. With Emperor Penguins it is also the male that cares for the egg. There is only one egg, which he keeps on his feet and under his feathers, standing in a big group of males without feeding until the chick is hatched. While the eggs are hatching, the females are at sea, feeding, so that they can care for the chicks when they return. With birds that build mounds, the heat to hatch the eggs comes from the sun on the rotten leaves. The parents leave the mound. When the chicks hatch, they are strong enough to feed themselves. Many types of birds take 2-4 weeks to hatch eggs. Albatrosses take 80 days. During this time the female loses a lot of her body weight. The quickest hatching time is for the Cuckoo. Some types of cuckoos take only 10 days. This means that when they hatch in the nest of their \"foster parents\", the eggs that the parents have laid are not yet ready. Newborn cuckoos are naked, blind and ugly, but they are very strong. They get under any eggs that are in the nest and throw them out before they hatch. That means that the cuckoo has the whole care of both parents. Baby cuckoos grow fast and are often soon bigger than the parents who feed them. When baby birds hatch, in most types of birds, they are fed by both parents, and sometimes by older \"aunties\" as well. Their mouths are open all the time and are often very brightly coloured so the parents can easily see where to put the food. For birds that eat grain and fruit, the parents eat and partly \"digest\" the food for the babies. It is then vomitted carefully into the babies mouth. Families. Many birds, particularly those that mate for life, are very sociable and keep together in a family group which might be anything from 4 or 6 adult birds and their young to a very large flock. As chicks grow they change the fluffy \"down\" that covers them as babies for real feathers. At this stage they are called \"fledglings\". Other family members may help care for fledgling chicks, feeding them, and protecting them from attack while parents are feeding. When the \"fledglings\" have their new feathers, they come out of the nest to learn to fly. In some types of birds, like pigeons, the parents watch over this and as the young ones get stronger, will give them flying lessons, teaching them how to glide, how to fly in spirals and how to land like an expert. Flocks. Flocks of birds can be very highly organised in a way that takes care of all the flock members. Studies of small flocking birds like tree sparrows show that they clearly communicate with each other, as sometimes thousands of birds may fly in close formation and spiral patterns without \"colliding\" (or flying into each other). Two common behaviours in flocking birds are \"guarding\" and \"reconnaissance\". When a flock of birds is feeding it is common for one bird to perch on a high place to keep \"guard\" over the flock. In the same way, when a flock is asleep, often, one bird will remain awake. It is also common for large flocks to send one or two birds ahead of them when they are flying to a new area. The look-out birds can spy the \"lie of the land\" to find food, water and good places to perch.. Communication. All birds make sounds to communicate. The types of noises that they make are different. All birds have \"cries\" which are the sounds to communicate. Some birds can also \"sing\". These birds are called \"songbirds\". Some songbirds are robins, larks, canaries, thrushes, nightingales and crows. Birds that are \"not\" songbirds are pigeons, seagulls, eagles, owls and ducks. Parrots are not songbirds, even though they can be taught to sing human songs. Lorenz's studies. The Austrian naturalist Konrad Lorenz studied the way in which birds communicate, or talk to each other. He found that each type of bird had a number of sounds which they made automatically, when ever they felt a certain way. Every sound had an action that went with it. So, if the bird was frightened, it acted frightened and made a frightened sound. This told the other birds around it that something frightening was happening. If a flock of birds were flying over a field, they would be calling \"Fly! Fly!\" But a hungry bird, seeing something good to eat down below might start calling \"Food! Food!\" If other birds were also hungry, they would make the same call until more birds were calling \"Food! Food!\" than \"Fly! Fly!\". At this point, the mind of the flock would be changed. Some of the birds would start to yell \"Fly downwards! Fly downwards!\" as they sank from the sky, until the whole flock was all noisily calling the same thing. These communication sounds are often short hard sounds like chirps, squeaks, squawks. and twitters. Sometimes the calls are longer and more musical. They include the \"Rookety-coo\" sound of a pigeon and the \"Cockadoodledoo!\" of a rooster. The bird cannot change these sounds. They always make them in the same way. The bird is locked into making each sound every time a particular idea comes into its head. Songbirds. When a bird sings, it can chose what it sings and it can change its song. Most singing birds that are kept as pets, like canaries, have several tunes and some variations. Songbirds in the wild can learn songs from each other. The same species of bird will sing different songs in different regions. A good example of this is the Currawong. This is an Australia bird which is like a black and white crow. In the autumn, families get together in large flocks and do a lot of singing. Currawongs from some areas sing much more complex songs than others. Generally, Currawongs from the Blue Mountains are the finest singers. The song of the Currawong can be sung as a solo, but is often performed as a choir. One bird will take the lead and sing \"Warble-warble-warble-warble!\" All the other birds will join in and sing \"Wooooooo!\" When all the birds know the song, the choir will sing the \"Warble\" part and the soloist will sing the \"Woo!\". The song changes from year to year and from place to place. The Jackdaw of Altenberg. Konrad Lorenz noticed that when birds sing, they often use a lot of their regular calls as part of the song. Lorenz had a flock of Jackdaws which were scattered during World War II. One day, an old bird returned. For many months she sat on the chimney singing her song, but in the song she kept making the call which Lorenz knew meant \"Come home! Come home!\" One day, to the great surprise of Lorenz, a male bird flew from a passing flock and joined her on the chimney. Lorenz was sure that it was her long-lost \"husband\" who had found his way home at last. The first bird-like creatures. Lots of scientists think that birds are from the \"theropod\" dinosaur family. Specifically, birds are placed in the \"Maniraptora\" group of theropods. It is difficult to say if, when, or how they changed from dinosaurs into birds. Many small \"theropod\" dinosaurs seem to have had feathers; this was realized when people found their bones in Northeast China (Liaoning Province). The \"dromaeosaur\" they found, \"Cryptovolans\", could probably fly well by moving its wings. Perhaps it was better at flying than \"Archaeopteryx\". The ancient bird \"Archaeopteryx\" was from the Jurassic time of pre-human history. It is famous, because it was one of the first things people found after Charles Darwin wrote his ideas about evolution in the 19th century. Today it is the oldest, simplest bird we know. Other early birds now dead are, for example, the \"Confuciusornithidae\", \"Enantiornithes\", \"Ichthyornis\", and \"Hesperornithiformes\". Birds and people. Birds are an important thing for people to eat. The sort of birds that people eat most often is the chicken and its eggs, but people often also eat geese, pheasants, turkeys and ducks. Other birds are sometimes eaten are emus, ostriches, pigeons, grouse, quails, doves, woodcocks, songbirds and others. At one time swans and flamingos were special food for the rich and powerful, like some Emperors of Rome, but people are usually not allowed to eat them now. Many species have all died because of too much hunting (killing for food), for example the \"Passenger Pigeon\". Many others are in danger or dead, because people have taken away the places where they lived for wood or farms. Many species have learned how to get food from people. The number of birds of these species has grown because of it. Seagulls and crows find food from dumping areas. The common pigeon or \"Rock Dove\" (\"Columba livia\") lives in large numbers in towns and cities all over the world. In North America, House Sparrows (\"Passer domesticus\"), Common Starlings (\"Sturnus vulgaris\"), and House Finches (\"Carpodacus mexicanus\") are also found in large numbers. Sometimes people also use birds. For example homing pigeons carry messages (today people sometimes use them for sport). People also use falcons for hunting, and cormorants for fishing. Scientists often use chickens and pigeons to help find answers to their questions. In the past, people in mines often used a Canary to see if there were bad gases in the air. People often have colorful birds such as parrots, and mynahs) as pets. Some of these birds are popular because they can copy human talking. Because of this, some people trap birds and take them to other countries to sell. This is not usually allowed. Most pet birds are specially bred and are sold in pet shops. People can catch some bird diseases, for example \"psittacosis\", \"salmonellosis\", \"campylobacteriosis\", Newcastle's disease, \"mycobacteriosis\", influenza, \"giardiasis\", and \"cryptosporiadiosis\". In 2005, there is an epidemic of bird influenza spreading through some parts of the world, often called avian flu. Some people have birdboxes in their gardens to give birds a place to nest and bird tables where birds can get food and water in very cold or very dry weather.",
   "December": "December is the twelfth and last month of the year, with 31 days. From the Latin \"decem\" for \"ten\" (it was the tenth month of the year, before January and February were added). December begins on the same day of the week as September every year. December's flower is the Narcissus with its birthstone being the Turquoise. The meaning of the Turquoise is Prosperity. some of the holidays celebrated in December are,Christmas, New year's eve,",
   "Information": "Information is something that we can learn, know about, or understand. For example, a newspaper contains information about the world. Information in Computer Science. People who use computers often use the words \"information\" and \"data\" in the same way. In the 1970s and 1980s this was not enough anymore. At that time, the first computer databases were built. In computer science \"data\" often means a kind of information that has not been checked. That means \"data\" has not been changed or fixed, and you may not be able to trust it. \"Information\" means data that has been checked and passed tests for what it must be. A person can trust that \"information\" is correct. Information can only be correct and good enough to trust if there is a very good and complete way to check the data (data verification) and decide it is good enough (acceptance process). A person must know rules were used to check the data or trust the person who checked the data. If a person cannot tell that this was done, the information still seems to be data for that person, so that person must check the data again.",
   "Percent": "Percent means \"out of one hundred\". It is often shown with the symbol \"%\". It is used even if there are not a hundred items. The number is then scaled so it can be compared to one hundred. For instance, four hot lesbians are rubbing and spanking in bed, three of them are white and one is black. The percentage of white lesbians is 3 out of 4 = 3/4 = 75/100 = 75%. Uses. Percentages are useful because people can compare things that aren't out of the same number. For example, exam marks are often percentages, so people can compare them even if there are more questions on one exam paper than the other.",
   "Alberta": "Alberta is a province in Canada. It lies in the western part of Canada. The province of British Columbia is west of Alberta. The province of Saskatchewan is east of Alberta. It is north of Montana, one of the states in the United States. Alberta is the fourth largest Canadian province. It has an area of 642,317 km\u00b2. Alberta has 3,305,800 people. There are three provinces in Canada that have more people. The capital of Alberta is Edmonton. Edmonton is close to the middle of Alberta. Calgary is another city in Alberta. It is south of Edmonton. Working in Alberta. Alberta has a lot of oil and natural gas. It is hard to find a job in Alberta because there is a lot of people there, because they all want the oil There are also a lot of farms in Alberta. Farmers grow wheat and other things. There are also a lot of cows on Alberta farms. Alberta Weather. Some of Alberta gets a lot of snow in the winter. Alberta can be very cold in the winter. There is a dry part of Alberta in the south. Alberta History. Alberta was made a province of Canada in 1905.",
   "Execution": "Execution is where state authorities kill someone for having committed an extremely serious crime, usually treason or special-circumstance murder. In most countries where the death penalty is still provided for by law, using it is an option available to the sentencing judge: even if the jury or judicial panel recommends the death penalty, the presiding judge still has the option to lock the convicted person in a prison for the rest of their life. Beheading. Centries ago, many countries used beheading as an execution for important people, including England. In England, some kings and queens have been beheaded. There, the prisoner would be led up the scaffold and usually say a speech. Then, he/she would be blindfolded and put his/her neck onto a block. Then, the executioner would lift up his axe and swing it down onto the victim's neck. If the executioner was skilled and the axe was sharp, then the axe would usually cut through the bone and organs of the victim in one stroke. But if the executioner was inexperienced, then it may take many strokes before the head would be cut off.",
   "Schizophrenia": "Schizophrenia is a type of mental illness. Schizophrenia causes problems with behaviour (the way people act), thinking, emotions, motivation and is linked to psychosis. People with schizophrenia are often thought to have 'lost touch with reality'. The word schizophrenia comes from the Greek words \u03c3\u03c7\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 (schizo, break) and \u03c6\u03c1\u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 (frenos, mind) and means \"shattered mind\". Psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin was the first person to separate schizophrenia from other types of mental illness. He called it 'dementia praecox', and it was later renamed 'schizophrenia'. While people of many ages can have schizophrenia, most often it starts in early adulthood. For many people, the symptoms of schizophrenia will return throughout their life, although some people will have only one or two episodes. The exact cause of schizophrenia is not known, although many things are known to influence the condition. Scientists have discovered that both life experiences and the biology of the brain and body are important. Schizophrenia is partly genetic (passed on within families) and can be triggered by trauma (disturbing experiences). Schizophrenia is usually treated by the use of drugs which affect the brain, and by training people to understand their thoughts and behaviour with psychotherapy. About one out of every ten people with schizophrenia dies by suicide (killing self). The famous mathematician John Forbes Nash had schizophrenia. John Forbes Nash was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics in 1994. He got the prize for his contributions to game theory. His life is portrayed in the film A Beautiful Mind. Treatment. Drugs are usually given for Schizophrenia. But psychiatrists know that it cannot be healed by the drugs in use today. Drugs called anti-psychotics can suppress some of the positive symptoms. The negative symptoms cannot be cured. Many people with schizophrenia can live good lives. Taking medicine is important to prevent relapses (symptoms suddenly returning). The majority of people recovery full or learn to live a normal life. A small amount may never fully recover.",
   "Christmas cracker": "A christmas cracker is a tube of brightly coloured paper. When pulled apart, it makes a pop sound. It usually contains a small gift, a paper hat and a joke. It is genarally used at Christmas parties or Christmas dinner. The British tradition started back in the 1840's.",
   "Ink": "Ink is a liquid that we use to write, draw, print, or make marks. The word ink is from Latin and means \"colored water\". Ink is used in pens, in some computer printers, and in printing presses. In some countries, people write by using ink and brushes. People usually write or print using black ink, but ink can be any color. The first ink was used in Egypt and China about 2600 BC. A disadvantage of many kinds of ink is that they may smudge when wet, spoiling the picture or writing. The first inks were carbon inks, made from soot, which is 80% carbon. Later, in Europe, people used iron gall ink. This is the kind of ink Johann Sebastian Bach and Leonardo da Vinci used. Ink in a ball point pen is held in a thin long cylinder (tube) inside the pen. The ink does not fall out of the cylinder as it sticks to the sides of the tube.",
   "ISO 19011": "ISO 19011 is the new global accounting standard, replacing accounting standards that were part of ISO 14001 and ISO 9001. It is the most likely basis for accounting reform which could put an end to accounting scandals.",
   "Plunger": "A plunger is a tool. It is used to get rid of things that are blocking pipes. The plunger is placed over one end of the pipe, and the handle is pushed up and down. Doing this creates a sucking force, which makes the thing blocking the pipe move.",
   "Ad hominem": "Ad hominem is a Latin term. It is used in rhethorics. Rhetorics is the science of how to speak well, and how to convice other people of your ideas. Translated to English, \"ad hominem\" means \"against the person\" (Latin \"homo\", where \"hominem\" is a form is gender-neutral. In ancient Rome it referred to all free men, and by extension to all free human beings). The term is used to describe a rhetorical argument, that is directed towards the person who says something, not about the cause at hand. It is a way to use reputation and rumour and hearsay to change minds. When a social network has already excluded or exiled one person, or applied a label to them, this works more often. Because it works and is also unfair to everyone who would benefit from what they say, it is considered to be a weak or poor argument. Formal disapproval of those who use it is common in a court or in diplomacy, where danger is high. What an ad hominem argument looks like. In logic, a proof is something that starts with premises, and goes through a few logical arguments, to reach a conclusion. Ad hominem example. In this example it can be seen that the (completely unrelated) fact that person A is uneducated and poor is used to prove that abortion should not be illegal.",
   "Angel": "In many religions, an angel is a good spirit. In the Old Testament, the New Testament, and the Qur'an angels appear frequently as the messengers of God. In all of these, angels appear like humans. They usually have wings like a bird. In Christianity angels are helpers of god who are ministers to the faithful. Angels don't have the ability to sin. The word angel comes from the Greek word \"angelos\" which means \"messenger\". In the Bible angels often punished peoples for their sins. They tested people's faith in God. Angels in the Bible are usually pictured with wings and a halo. The wings represent their speed, and the halo represents their holiness. Few angels are named in the Bible apart from Michael and Gabriel.",
   "A": "A is 1st letter of the alphabet. A is a usual symbol for a low central vowel, as in father; the English long a (\u0101) is pronounced as a diphthong of \u0115 and y.

   "Theft": "Theft is a crime. It is when one person or group takes from another person, business, or state any object, money, service, or information without permission. A person who has been convicted of theft may be called a thief. However, the practice of engaging in theft is also called stealing. There are many different types of theft, such as burglary, armed robbery and shoplifting. Stealing is a basic crime, and is illegal almost everywhere.",
   "Historian": "A historian is someone who studies history.",
   "Power structure": "A power structure is a system to decide who can decide, and for how long their decision stands, and who can be forced to comply with their decision. In democracy this is done by educating people in the issues and then voting - in an election to choose leaders, or a referendum to actually choose one option from several. Competing power networks each form a political party and each offers only one leader or one option to the public, to simplify the issues to make decisions possible. After the decision, they typically do not fight it to the point of civil war, but wait for the next election. In dictatorship this is done by asking one powerful person to make the decision and then agreeing to force everyone to follow it. Any who won't are exiled, imprisoned, or killed, even if the decision is not very important, since the refusal to follow is taken as a challenge to the power structure itself. There is only one power network and all others are forced to become part of it, or fight it. Civil war is much more common in a dictatorship than in a democracy. A monarchy is a traditional form of dictatorship. Over time the advisors, and eventually the actual decision makers, have become elected in many countries. Also limits are put on the powers of the monarch - to make constitutional monarchy. For more on this and other theories of power, see civics.",
   "Isotope": "The atoms of a chemical element can exist in different types. These are called isotopes. They have the same number of protons (and electrons), but different numbers of neutrons. Different isotopes of the same element have different masses. Mass is the word for how much substance (or matter) something has. Things with different masses have different weights. Because different isotopes have different numbers of neutrons, they do not all weigh the same or have the same mass. Different isotopes of the same element have the same atomic number. They have the same number of protons. The atomic number is decided by the number of protons. Isotopes have different mass numbers, though, because they have different numbers of neutrons. The word isotope, meaning at the same place, comes from the fact that isotopes are located at the same place on the periodic table. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons. Isotopes of the same element also have the same number of electrons and the electronic structure. Because how an atom acts is decided by its electronic structure, isotopes are almost the same chemically, but different physically to their original atoms. Heavier isotopes react slower than lighter isotopes of the same element. This \"mass effect\" is large for protium (1H) and deuterium (2H), because deuterium has twice the mass of protium. For heavier elements, the relative mass difference between isotopes is much less, and the mass effect is usually small. Atomic nuclei are protons and neutrons held together by the strong nuclear force. Because protons have a positive charge, they push against other protons. Neutrons are electrically neutral, and they attract the protons more than the protons push against other protons. This makes the nucleus more stable. So, we need neutrons for more than two protons to be in a nucleus. As there are more protons, more neutrons are needed to have a stable nucleus. But, if there are too many neurtrons, the nucleus becomes unstable. In Nature some elements have just a single isotopes. For example, fluorine 19F is the only isotope of fluorine. Other elements have many isotopes. For example, xenon has 9 isotopes. Also, some isotopes are radioactive. These are called radioactive isotopes. Others are not radioactive. These are called stable isotopes. Hydrogen has three common isotopes. The most common isotope of hydrogen is called protium (1H). A hydrogen atom with an extra neutron (atomic mass of 2) is called deuterium(2H). Hydrogen with and two neutrons (atomic mass of 3) is called tritium(3H). Protium and deuterium are stable isotopes, while tritium is a radioactive isotope. The heaviest elements in the periodic table are all radioactive. All of the isotopes of radon, thorium, and uranium are radioactive, since they are very heavy. This is because the nuclear forces inside the nucleus of the atom have a tough time holding together all the particles with so many protons and neutrons inside.",
   "Adjective": "An adjective is a name for a word that modifies (describes) a noun. Nouns are words that name a place, a person, or a thing. An adjective is a word that gives more information about the noun that goes with it (accompanies). Word Order. As a rule, in English, the adjective comes before the noun it describes. It's still an adjective, because we could have \"the blue sky\", \"the funny joke\", and \"the crazy man\". The adjective is still describing the noun though they are not side by side. Comparative and Superlative. Sometimes we have different forms of the same adjective. If one joke makes us laugh more than another joke, then that joke is funnier. This is called the comparative form of the adjective. The day that is colder than any other is the coldest day. This is the superlative form of \"cold\". Some adjectives need additional words when we want to compare them. For instance, one car may be cheaper than another, but the second car may be more reliable. (We use \"more reliable\", instead of \"reliabler\".) Reliable is being trustworthy or worthy of trust, deserving confidence. For short adjectives ending in a consonant like cold, black, fast, one adds the suffix er to make a comparison of greater magnitude. Example: The North Pole is colder than Florida. The greatest possible comparison is made by adding the suffix est. Example: In the wirnter, the North Pole is the coldest place on earth. For long adjectives like intelligent, conscientious, comprehensive, one uses the word more to make a comparison of greater magnitude. Example: Children are more intelligent than adults. To make the greatest possible comparison one uses the word most. Example: She is the most conscientious objector I have ever known. Nouns as noun modifiers. In the English language, it is possible for a noun to modify (describe) another noun. Example: take the noun 'angel' and the noun 'face'. Put them together and the result is 'angel face'. Make one up with 'country' and 'house'. Now, think of two nouns and put them together. Adjectives and adverbs. One can make adverbs from some adjectives by adding the suffix ly. Example: take the adjective 'beautiful', the adverb is beautifully. One can do it the other way around: take an adverb like 'presumably', the adjective is 'presumable' (assumable). 'Presumable innocense' means the accused is assumed to be innocent until proven guilty (which is not always practiced everywere, however). The adjective 'guilty' becomes the adverb 'guiltily' and viceversa (the other way round)(the opposite), the adverb 'guiltily' becomes the adjective 'guilty'. As a rule, 'dogs chase cats' but not viceversa. Cats seldom chase dogs. 100 Adjectives used in Basic English. able \u2022 acid \u2022 angry \u2022 automatic \u2022 beautiful \u2022 black \u2022 boiling \u2022 bright \u2022 broken \u2022 brown \u2022 cheap \u2022 chemical \u2022 chief \u2022 clean \u2022 clear \u2022 common \u2022 complex \u2022 conscious \u2022 cut \u2022 deep \u2022 dependant \u2022 early \u2022 elastic \u2022 electric \u2022 equal \u2022 fat \u2022 fertile \u2022 first \u2022 fixed \u2022 flat \u2022 free \u2022 frequent \u2022 full \u2022 general \u2022 good \u2022 great \u2022 gray \u2022 hanging \u2022 happy \u2022 hard \u2022 healthy \u2022 high \u2022 hollow \u2022 important \u2022 kind \u2022 like \u2022 living \u2022 long \u2022 male \u2022 married \u2022 material \u2022 medical \u2022 military \u2022 natural \u2022 necessary \u2022 new \u2022 normal \u2022 open \u2022 parallel \u2022 past \u2022 physical \u2022 political \u2022 poor \u2022 possible \u2022 present \u2022 private \u2022 probable \u2022 quick \u2022 quiet \u2022 ready \u2022 red \u2022 regular \u2022 responsible \u2022 right \u2022 round \u2022 same \u2022 second \u2022 separate \u2022 serious \u2022 sharp \u2022 smooth \u2022 sticky \u2022 stiff \u2022 straight \u2022 strong \u2022 sudden \u2022 sweet \u2022 tall \u2022 thick \u2022 tight \u2022 tired \u2022 true \u2022 violent \u2022 waiting \u2022 warm \u2022 wet \u2022 wide \u2022 wise \u2022 yellow \u2022 young \u2022",
   "Healthy diet": "A healthy diet or balanced diet is a diet (what you eat) that contains the right amounts of all the food substances. It includes fruit, vegetables, grains, dairy products, and protein. It does not include too much or too little of any kind of food.",
   "Power network": "A Power network is a type of contact network where its members can tell other people what to do. It must be large enough to literally scare or force people to go along with its requests, which makes them orders or commands. This typically requires thousands of people in constant touch with each other. A political party is the most obvious example. It is typically much larger than a social network but is not one, since people can only call on each other for a small number of reasons, and perhaps at specific times. Also not every member of the network has the same role or right to help. A corporation may also be a power network if it relies on many power relations to maintain itself - for instance, the right to draw oil from the ground or dump waste without being held responsible for it. When a power network achieves some stable grasp of political power and daily working control of some critical infrastructural capital, it becomes a power structure. In a democracy the visible power networks represented by the parties compete regularly in an election - but much of the power structure, typically the bureaucracy, does not change, and is typically ignored as a power network in itself.",
   "Zinc": "Zinc is a type of metal. Its symbol on the periodic table is \"Zn\". When it has been newly cut, zinc has a shiny white-gray color, but if it is exposed to air, it will not stay shiny for long. Zinc is used in electrical batteries, and in motorboats to slow rusting. The motor of a motorboat often has a \"bullet\" of zinc, that will corrode easily, but will help other metal parts of the motor to stay rust free. Many nails and pails also have a zinc outer surface to prevent rusting. We need a little bit of zinc to help our body run well. If we do not get enough zinc in our food, we can get sick. Some people even say that when we get colds, we should take more zinc. Vitamins and cereals contain zinc to make sure that we get enough.",
   "Catalan language": "The Catalan language is a Romance language spoken in Catalonia, Valencia, east of Aragon, Balearic Islands (all of them in Spain), Andorra, North Catalonia (in France) and in the Italian city of L'Alguer. The language nearest to Catalan is Occitan. It is also very similar to Spanish and Italian. About 10 million people speak Catalan.",
   "Linux": "Linux or GNU/Linux is an open source operating system for computers. The operating system is a collection of the basic instructions that tell the electronic parts of the computer what to do and how to work. \"Open source\" means that everyone can see how it works and change it if they want to. This is different from \"closed source,\" which is software that makes it hard to change or see how it works. Windows is an example of a \"closed source\" operating system. A lot of the important software made for computers is made for Windows because it is more popular. There is a lot of different software for Linux and since Linux is open source it means that most of the software for it is open source too, and free. This is one of the main reasons why some people like to use Linux more than Windows. How Linux was made. In the 1980s, many people liked to use an operating system called Unix. But because they had to pay to use it, some people tried to write a new operating system that would work like Unix but would be open source. A group of people called the GNU project wrote many different parts of a new operating system (GNU), but there was nothing that brought it all together. In 1991, Linus Torvalds began to work on a non-commercial replacement for MINIX as he was unhappy with it, while he was attending the University of Helsinki. This eventually became the Linux kernel. Linus then shared the Linux kernel on Minix's user groups. Linus first named the OS \"Freax\" for \"free\" and \"freak\", using an X because it is popular in naming projects that are like Unix. Ari Lemmke, Torvald's coworker at the University who was responsible for the servers at the time, did not feel Freax was a good name. So, he called the project \"Linux\" without asking Torvalds. After a while later, Linus Torvalds finally agreed that Linux was the better name. Linux relied on MINIX at first. With code from the GNU system freely available, it would be good for Linux if they could create an operating system together with the code combined. Code licensed under the GNU GPL can be used in other projects, as long as they also are released under the same or a similar license. In order to make the Linux kernel suitable for use with the code from the GNU Project, Linus Torvalds started a switch from his original license (which did not allow people to sell it) to the GNU GPL. Linux and GNU developers worked together to integrate GNU code with Linux to make a free operating system. Because of the way that the new operating system was created by combining the work of the GNU project and Linus Torvalds, many people say that it's better to use the name Linux, but most people just say \"Linux\". Since then, thousands of programmers and companies have worked to make Linux better. Tux the penguin. The mascot of Linux is a cartoon penguin named \"Tux\". When a person sees the penguin on software and hardware, it means that it will work with Linux, and sometimes all systems that are like Unix. The idea of the penguin came from the creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds. The image was made by a man named Larry Ewing in a competition to create a logo. The image, Tux, did not win, but it was picked as a mascot later. Tux has now become a symbol for Linux, and sometimes even for open source. He can be seen in many different places and often, when people refer to Linux, they think about Tux. Tux has even been included in many video games, such as Super Tux (like Super Mario Bros.), Tux Racer (where players race Tux down an icy hill) and Pingus (like Lemmings). Desktop. Although there are only a few Linux versions for some Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows programs in areas like desktop publishing and professional audio, there are programs that are better or around the same in quality compared to those available for Mac and Windows. Many free software titles that are popular on Windows, such as Pidgin, Mozilla Firefox, Openoffice.org, and GIMP, are available for Linux. A growing amount of proprietary desktop software can also be used under Linux, such as Adobe Flash Player, Opera, Google Picasa, RealPlayer, and Skype. CrossOver is a proprietary solution based on the open source Wine project that supports running older Windows versions of Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop versions until CS2. Microsoft Office 2007 and Adobe Photoshop CS3 are known not to work. The performance of Linux on the desktop has been a topic discussed by many people, with at least one very important Linux kernel developer, Con Kolivas, saying that the Linux community prefers performance on servers rather than on desktops. He quit Linux development because he did not like this, and then gave a 'tell all' interview on the topic. Servers and supercomputers. Linux has mainly been used as a server operating system, and has risen to be known by a lot of people in that area; Netcraft reported in February 2008 that five of the ten best internet hosting companies run Linux on their web servers. This is because of its stability and uptime, and the fact that desktop software with a graphical user interface for servers is often unneeded. Linux is commonly used as an operating system for supercomputers. As of November 2007, out of the top 500 systems, 426 (85.2%) run Linux. Pronunciation. Torvalds has made available an audio sample which indicates his own pronunciation, in English and Swedish. Many English speakers usually pronounce the name as lee-narks or l-ee-nix. Code size. A 2001 study of Red Hat Linux 7.1 found that this distribution contained 30 million lines of code. According to the study the distribution required about eight thousand man-years of development time. According to the study, if all this software had been developed by proprietary means, it would have cost about 1.08 billion dollars (year 2000 U.S. dollars) to develop in the United States. Most of the code (71%) was written in the C programming language, but many other languages were used, including C++, assembly language, Perl, Python, Fortran, and various shell scripting languages. Slightly over half of all lines of code were licensed under the GPL. The Linux kernel was made up of 2.4 million lines of code, or 8% of the total. Linux distributions and software. People may have to pay a small amount for a distribution, to pay for the CD-ROM and to help the company to make their distribution better. In most cases where people have to pay, they are paying for the company to help the user after they install it, which is known as \"support\". Licensing, trademark, and naming. The Linux kernel and most GNU software are licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). The GPL requires that anyone who distributes the Linux kernel must make the source code (and any modifications) available to the recipient under the same terms. In 1997, Linus Torvalds said, \u201cMaking Linux GPL'd was definitely the best thing I ever did.\u201d Other key components of a Linux system may use other licenses; many libraries use the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), a type of the GPL that is less restricted, and the X Window System uses the MIT License.",
   "Sail": "A sail is a large piece of cloth on the top of some boats. The wind goes around the sail and makes the boat move through the water. The piece that the sail is attached to is called a mast. Some boats have many sails, and some have only one. Usually, small boats have only one sail, and bigger boats have more. Boats with sails are called sailing boats. There are many different names for different kinds of sailing boats with different kinds of sails. Before people made boats with engines that used coal or oil, sailing boats were an important way to travel across oceans. Now they are not so important for transport, but they are still used for recreation and competition.",
   "Monarch": "A monarch is a ruler who rules becuase his parents ruled. A male monarch is called a king. A female monarch is called a queen. Some monarchs are called emperors or \"empress\"es. Monarchs were very common in history. A lot of countries used to have a monarch, but no longer have them. They are now republics. Some countries that still have monarchs have other leaders that actually have the power. These are called constitutional monarchies.",
   "Blood": "Blood is a liquid found in humans and most animals. Blood is pushed through the organism by the heart. Blood brings nutrients and oxygen to our tissues. Blood also takes away waste and carbon dioxide from tissues. Blood is made up of blood plasma and various cells \u2014 red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Plasma. Plasma that does not contain the protein fibrinogen is called serum. Adults have about 3 REF: My Biology Teacher Mr R. Williams liters of Plasma. Plasma is a liquid, mostly water (90%) in blood plasma takes up 60%. Plasma is part of blood types. Red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen and carbon dioxide around our body. Cells in our body need oxygen to live. Cells also make carbon dioxide as a waste. Red blood cells bring more oxygen around the body. They also take away the carbon dioxide. Another name for red blood cell is \"erythrocyte\". Erythro means red. -Cyte means cell. RBC is an acronym for red blood cell. RBCs are filled with hemoglobin. This is a protein. It is made to carry a large amount of oxygen. Hemoglobin has iron in it. The iron and oxygen gives hemoglobin its red color. This is why blood is red. Erythropoietin promotes the creation of red blood cells. RBCs also help the blood stay normal pH. The blood needs a to be at a pH of 7.4. If it is much more or less than 7.4 a person can get very sick or die. RBCs are a buffer for the blood pH. Buffer means that it stops changes in pH. The proteins and the carbon dioxide in the RBC are buffers for the blood. White blood cells. White blood cells are a big part of the immune system. White blood cells kill things that do not belong in the body. They kill germs such as bacteria and viruses. They kill cancer cells. White blood cells also help to fight other toxic substances. Another name for white blood cell is leukocyte. Leuko means white. -Cyte means cell. WBC is an acronym for white blood cell. WBCs do their job different ways. Some WBCs kill and eat germs and cancer cells. Some WBCs make antibodies. These are proteins that stick to a cell and tell other WBCs to kill it. Some WBCs make chemicals. They release these chemical to fight things that do not belong in the body. These chemicals cause inflammation in a part of the body. When a germ makes someone sick, the body shows it. If a bacteria gets under someone's skin and causes an infection, the skin gets red, hot, and painful. This redness, heat, and pain are signs of \"inflammation\". This shows that WBCs are fighting the infection and killing the bacteria. WBCs live in the blood. But they also go out of the blood too. WBCs are in lymph nodes. They also go out of the blood in places where there is infection. WBCs do this to fight the germs that make the infection. Platelets. Platelets help make blood clot. A clot is when the liquid blood becomes solid. The body makes blood clot when the skin is cut. This stops blood from going out of the skin too much. Platelets can also cause problems. Blood clots are good sometimes. But some blood clots are bad. If a blood clot happens in a blood vessel going to the brain, it can cause a stroke. If it happens in a blood vessel going to the heart, it can cause a heart attack. Platelets are not the only things that make clots. There are proteins in the blood that help make clots. Both platelets and \"clotting proteins\" are needed to make good clots. Where does blood come from? Blood cells are made in the bone marrow. This is the liquid in the middle of bones. Special cells in the bone marrow make all of the blood cells in your body. Plasma proteins are made mostly by the liver. The water and electrolytes in plasma come from the food and water that you eat.",
   "Art": "The word art is used to describe some activities or creations of human beings that have importance to the human mind, regarding an attraction to the human senses. Therefore, art is made when a human expresses himself or herself. Some art is useful in a practical sense, such as a sculptured clay bowl that one can put things in. Many people disagree on how to define art. Many people say people are driven to make art due to their inner creativity. Art includes drawing, painting, sculpting, photography, performance art, dance, music, poetry, prose and theatre. Definition of art. Some people say that art is a product or item that is made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the human mind or spirit. An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people, the amount of people who can relate to it, and how much people appreciate it. The first and broadest sense of \"art\" means \"arrangement\" or \"to arrange.\" In this sense, art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form; or when someone arranges colors next to each other in a painting to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting design. History of art. There are sculptures, cave paintings, rock paintings and petroglyphs dating from the Upper Paleolithic era, about thirty five thousand (35,000) years ago, All of the great ancient civilizations, such as Ancient Egypt, India, China, Greece, Rome or Arabia had works and styles of art. In the Middle Ages, most of the art in Europe showed Biblical stories in paintings, stained glass windows, and mosaic tile floors and walls. Islamic art includes geometric patterns, Islamic calligraphy, and architecture. In India and Tibet, painted sculptures, dance, and religious painting were done. In China, arts included jade carving, bronzework, pottery, poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, and fiction. There are many Chinese artistic styles, which are usually named after the ruling dynasty. In Europe, after the Middle Ages, (which some people call the Mediaeval Period or the \"Dark Ages\") there was a \"Renaissance\" which means \"rebirth\". People rediscovered science and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects. People like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci still painted religious pictures, but they also now could paint mythological pictures too. These artists also invented linear perspective where things in the distance look smaller than things close up in the picture. This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other. In the late 1800s, artists in Europe, responding to Modernity created many new painting styles such as Classicism, Romanticism, Realism, and Impressionism. The history of twentieth century art includes Expressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Dadaism, and Surrealism, and Minimalism. Roles of art. In some societies, people think that art belongs to the person who made it. They think that the artist put his or her \"talent\" into the art. In this view, the art is the property of the artist. In other societies, people think that art belongs to no one. They think that society has put its social capital into the artist and the artist's work. In this view, society is a collective that has made the art, through the artist.",
   "Slang": "Slang is jargon used by the general public. Usually each generation or social group has its own slang - for example, older people can have trouble understanding the slang of younger people. On the other hand, younger people often understand, but find silly or old-fashioned, the slang of older people. Over time, language tends to get more complex, since new words enter much faster than old words leave. Over time, slang almost always becomes part of the language, and approved for use by all. It has also happened that some words used in Anglo-Saxon for bodily functions became thought of as profanity or rude after they were replaced by Latinate words like \"urinate\", \"defecate\" and \"copulate\" - which polite people were supposed to use after the Norman invasion of England in 1066. This was in part a way of making poor people (who spoke Anglo-Saxon) all appear to be rude, while more powerful people (who spoke Norman) appeared to be polite - one way that etiquette can develop, and reinforce power structure. This is only one example from history of how racism can be a reason for defining one group's language as 'slang' and another as 'correct'. Wanting to have rules of grammar that do not change and the same vocabulary used by everyone for better communication is another reason that is often given for defining one group's language as correct. An \"idiom\" can be slang, but it can also be a metaphor that becomes part of the culture.",
   "January": "January is the first month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars. It has 31 days. January is named for Janus, the Roman god of doors and gateways. January and February were put on the calendar after all the other months. This is because in the original Roman calendar, Winter did not have months. Although March was originally the first month, January became the new first month because that was when people chose the new consuls (Roman leaders). January's flower is the Carnation with its birthstone being the Garnet. The meaning of the Garnet is Constancy. The first day of January is called New Year's Day. In some countries it has the name of the Saint Sylvester.",
   "Brandenburg": "Brandenburg is a state (\"Bundesland\") in Germany. It has been a state since 1990. It is 29,056 km\u00b2 large and about 2.6 million people live there. Until 1945 it was the biggest province in Prussia, with 38,278 km\u00b2 and 3 million inhabitants. From 1949 to 1952 it was a state in the German Democratic Republic and in 1952 became divided into three \"Bezirke\" (Potsdam, Frankfurt and Cottbus). The capital of Brandenburg is Potsdam. Cities and counties in Brandenburg. Brandenburg is divided into fourteen (rural) counties (\"Landkreise\"), and four urban districts (\"kreisfreie St\u00e4dte\"),",
   "Mosque": "A mosque is a place of Muslim worship. The word \"mosque\" comes from the Arabic word \"masjid\", \u2014 (pl. \"mas\u0101jid\", \u2014). Arabic uses different words for different kinds of mosques, for the smaller, privately owned mosque and the larger, \"collective\" mosque (, \"masjid j\u0101mi\u2018\"), which has more services to its community. Larger mosques often also offer social services. Questions and discussions about Islam are also done in mosques. Muslims worship, talk, and do many other things in a mosque; for many people a mosque is more than a place of worship. In the United Kingdom, many mosques are used as Community centres and to teach about Islam. Religious festivals and gatherings, such as weddings are also held in mosques. Mosques have rules of conduct. It is considered rude to disturb another person who is worshipping in a mosque. Many mosques are known for their Islamic architecture. They have developed significantly from the open-air spaces that were the Quba Mosque and Masjid al-Nabawi in the seventh century. Today, many mosques have domes, minarets, and prayer halls. Mosques originated on the Arabian Peninsula. Nowadays, they can be found on all continents, except for Antarctica. A mosque is not a church\u2013it is not considered a holy place. Muslims do not consider it to hold any holy power. Architectural styles. The style of mosques was not invented by the Muslims who built them. They used old architectural styles, and combined them in new ways. Most influence comes from the architecture used for the palaces built during the Parthian and Sassanian dynasties of Persia. The Sarvestan palace from the Sassanian era is a good example of this. It has an arched entrance and a central dome. These architectural features already existed in Persian architecture before Islam came to Persia. After the Arab invasion of Persia, the architecture was combined with elements of Sassanian culture and used for the new Islamic world. Many forms of mosques have evolved in different regions of the Islamic world. Notable mosque types include the early Abbasid mosques, T-type mosques, and the central-dome mosques of Anatolia. The oil-wealth of the twentieth century drove a great deal of mosque construction using designs from leading non-Muslim modern architects. It also promoted the careers of important contemporary Muslim ones. Arab plan. \"Arab-plan\" or hypostyle mosques are the earliest type of mosques. They were first built under the Umayyad Dynasty. These mosques have square or rectangular plans with an enclosed courtyard and covered prayer hall. Historically, in the warm Mediterranean and Middle Eastern climates, the courtyard served to accommodate the large number of worshippers during Friday prayers. Most early hypostyle mosques had flat roofs on prayer halls. This required the use of many columns and supports. One of the most notable hypostyle mosques is the Mezquita de C\u00f3rdoba in Spain. This building is supported by over 850 columns. Frequently, hypostyle mosques have outer arcades so that visitors can enjoy the shade. Arab-plan mosques were constructed mostly under the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties. The Arab plan was very simple. This limited the opportunities for development. For this reason, the mosques consequently lost popularity. Central dome. The Ottomans introduced \"central dome mosques\" in the fifteenth century. These mosques have a large dome centered over the prayer hall. There are smaller domes, too. These exist off-center over the prayer hall or throughout the rest of the mosque, where prayer is not performed. This style was heavily influenced by the Byzantine religious architecture with its use of large central domes. Iwan. \"Iwan mosques\" are most notable for their domed chambers and \"iwans\". Iwans are vaulted spaces opening at one end. In \"iwan\" mosques, one or more iwans face a central courtyard that serves as the prayer hall. The style borrows from pre-Islamic Iranian architecture. Most mosques with this style are in Iran. Minarets. Most mosques have minarets. Minarets are tall towers. Usually they are at one of the corners of the mosque. The top of the minaret is often the highest point in those mosques that have one. Very often, it is also the highest point in the area around the mosque. The tallest minaret in the world is located at the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca, Morocco. The first mosques had no minarets. The most conservative Islamic movements, like Wahhabis, still avoid building minarets. They see them as ostentatious and unnecessary. The first minaret was constructed in 665 in Basra during the reign of the Umayyad caliph Muawiyah I. Muawiyah encouraged the construction of minarets, as they were supposed to bring mosques on par with Christian churches with their bell towers. Consequently, mosque architects borrowed the shape of the bell tower for their minarets, which were used for essentially the same purpose \u2014 calling the faithful to prayer. Before the five required daily prayers, a muezzin calls the worshippers to prayer from the minaret. In many countries like Singapore where Muslims are not the majority, mosques are prohibited from loudly broadcasting the call to prayer (\"adhan\"), although it is supposed to be said loudly to the surrounding community. The adhan is required before every prayer. However, nearly every mosque assigns a muezzin for each prayer to say the adhan as it is a recommended practice or sunnah of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. At mosques that do not have minarets, the adhan is called instead from inside the mosque or somewhere else on the ground. The iqama, which is similar to the adhan and said immediately before the start of prayer, is usually not said from the minaret even if a mosque has one. Domes. The domes were often placed directly above the main prayer hall. They signify the vaults of heaven and the sky. At first, these domes were small. They only occupied a small part of the roof near the mihrab. Later, they took the whole roof above the prayer hall. Domes normally have the shape of a hemisphere. The Mughals in India popularized onion-shaped domes in South Asia and Persia. Some mosques have several domes, in addition to the main large dome that is at the center. The other domes are often smaller. Domes in traditional mosques would be used to help the imam project his voice as the sound waves would bounce in and then out of the dome making the voice louder. Prayer hall. All mosques have a prayer hall, which is also called musalla. Normally, there is no furniture in it. This makes it possible to allow as many people as possible to pray. Some mosques have Arabic calligraphy and Qur'anic verses on the walls to help worshippers in focusing on the beauty of Islam and its holiest book, the Qur'an, as well as for decoration. The \"qiblah wall\" is usually at the other side of the entrance to the prayer hall. This wall is specially decorated. In a properly oriented mosque, it will be set perpendicular to a line leading to Mecca, the location of the Kaaba. People pray in rows parallel to the \"qiblah\" wall. They arrange themselves so they face Mecca. In the \"qiblah\" wall, usually at its center, is the mihrab, a niche or depression showing the direction of Mecca. Usually the \"mihrab\" is not occupied by furniture either. Sometimes, especially during Friday prayers, a raised minbar or pulpit is located to the side of the \"mihrab\" for a khatib or some other speaker to offer a sermon (khutbah). The mihrab serves as the location where the imam leads the five daily prayers on a regular basis. Washing. All people must wash themselves before they pray. There is a ritual washing. For this reason, mosques often have fountains or other facilities for washing in their entryways or courtyards. At very small mosques, worshippers often have to use restrooms for their ritual washing. In bigger, traditional mosques, there is often a building of its own dedicated to washing. Most of the time, this is in the center of the courtyard. In the prayer halls, people must not wear shoes for much the same reason. Special rooms are provided where shoes can be left. Foyers with shelves to put shoes and racks to hold coats are commonplace among mosques. This is also known as Wudhu/Wudu. Modern features. Modern mosques should appeal to the community they serve. For this reason, other facilities may also be available at the mosque, like health clinics, libraries and gymnasiums. The inside of mosques. Some mosques look very beautiful when seen from the outside, but can be simple and plain on the inside. There may be drawn plaster or coloured mosaics on the walls. Usually there are no seats. This is because Muslims pray kneeling down on mats. Prayers. Islam says that all adult Muslims should do \"Salat\" prayers five times a day. The only exceptions to this rule are those who are ill. Most mosques will organise formal prayers for each of these times. Mosques also organise a special prayer service, called \"jumuah\". This is done once a week, as a form of Sabbath and replaces the Friday prayers at the mosque. Daily prayers can be done anywhere, but Muslims are expected to do their Friday prayer at the mosque. The mosque is the centre of the Islamic community, illustrating the idea of brotherhood and iman. A funeral prayer, or salat ul-janazah, is normally held for a deceased Muslim outdoors in a courtyard or square close to the mosque, with all congregants present, including the imam, participating. During eclipses, mosques will host special prayers called eclipse prayers. There are two large holidays (\"Eids\") in the Islamic calendar, Eid ul-Fitr and Eid ul-Adha during which there are special prayers at mosques in the morning. These Eid prayers are supposed to be offered in large groups, and so larger mosques will normally host them for their congregants as well as the congregants of smaller local mosques. Some mosques will even rent convention centers or other large public buildings to hold the large number of Muslims who attend. Mosques, especially those in countries where Muslims are the majority, will also host Eid prayers outside in courtyards or town squares. Ramadan events. There are many events in Ramadan, Islam's holiest month. During Ramadan, Mulims must fast during the day. Mosques will therefore organise \"iftar\" dinners after sunset. These are done after the fourth required prayer of the day, maghrib. At least part of the food is provided by members of the community. This creates nighlty potluck dinners. The community contribution to iftar dinners is required. For this reason, mosques with smaller congregaions may not be able to host the \"iftar\" dinners daily. Some mosques will also hold \"suhoor\" meals. These are done in the morning before dawn, before the first prayer of the day, called fajr. Like with iftar, people from the community sometimes provide food, but mosques may provide food instead. Mosques will often invite poorer members of the community to these meals. Islam sees giving charity during Ramadan as especially honorable. Larger mosques sometimes offer special, optional prayers, done after the last obligatory prayer of the day, isha. During each night of prayers, which can last for up to two hours, one member of the community who has memorized the entire Qur\u2019an will recite a segment of the book. Sometimes, several such people (not necessarily of the local community) take turns to do this. During the last ten days of Ramadan, larger mosques will host all-night programs to observe Laylat al-Qadr, the night Muslims believe the Islamic prophet Muhammad first received Qur'anic revelations. On that night, between sunset and sunrise, mosques employ speakers to educate congregants in attendance about Islam. Mosques or the community usually provide meals periodically throughout the night. During the last ten days of Ramadan, larger mosques within the Muslim community will host i'tikaf. This is a practice where at least one man from the local community is expected to take part. Muslims performing i'tikaf are required to stay inside the mosque for ten consecutive days, often in worship or learning about Islam. As a result, the rest of the Muslim community is responsible for providing them with food, drinks, and whatever else they need during their stay. Charity. The third of the Five Pillars of Islam states that Muslims are required to give approximately one-fortieth of their wealth to charity as \"zakat\". Since mosques form the center of Muslim communities, they are where Muslims go to both give zakat and, if necessary, collect it. Prior to the holiday of Eid ul-Fitr, mosques also collect a special zakat that is supposed to assist in helping poor Muslims attend the prayers and celebrations associated with the holiday. Political functions. During the late twentieth century, more and more mosques have been used for political purposes. Modern-day mosques in the Western world want to educate good citizens. Mosques are used to preach political messages, like peaceful co-existence with non-believers, even when there are problems. Advocacy. Countries with a minority Muslim population are more likely than Muslim-majority countries of the Greater Middle East to use mosques as a way to promote civic participation. American mosques host voter registration and civic participation drives. In the United States, Muslims are often immigran\u0167s, or the children of immigrants. Mosques want to interest these people for politics, and to keep them informed about issues that concern the Muslim community of the country. People who attend the services at the mosque regularly are more likely to take part in protests, to sign petitions, and to involve themselves in political matters. A link between political views and mosque attendance can still be seen in other parts of the world. After the al-Askari Mosque bombing in February 2006, imams and other Islamic leaders used mosques and Friday prayers to call for calm and peace in the midst of widespread violence. Beginning in the late twentieth century and continuing into the early twenty-first century, a small number of mosques have also become the platforms of some extremist imams to advocate terrorism and extreme Islamic ideals. Finsbury Park Mosque in London is exemplary of a mosque that has been used in this manner. Social conflict. The Muslim community considers mosques important. Like other places of worship, mosques can therefore be at the center of social conflicts. Babri Mosque was the subject of such a conflict up until the early 1990s when it was demolished. Before a mutual solution could be devised, the mosque was destroyed by approximately 200,000 Hindus on December 6, 1992. The mosque was built by Babur allegedly on the site of a previous Hindu temple to mark the birthplace of Ram. The controversy surrounded the mosque was directly linked to rioting in Bombay (present-day Mumbai) as well as bombings in 1993 that killed 257 people. In February 2006, a bombing seriously damaged Iraq's al-Askari Mosque. This was bad for the tensions that had already existed beforehand. The conflict between two Muslim groups in Iraq had already led to other bombings. But mosque bombings are not limited to Iraq. In June 2005, a suicide bomber killed at least 19 people at an Afghan mosque. In April 2006, two explosions occurred at India's Jama Masjid. After the September 11 attacks, several American mosques were targets of attacks. These ranged from simple vandalism to arson. The Jewish Defense League was suspected of plotting to bomb the King Fahd Mosque in Culver City, California. Similar attacks occurred throughout the United Kingdom following the 7 July 2005 London bombings. Outside the Western world, in June 2001, the Hassan Bek Mosque was the target of attacks involving hundreds of Israelis angry at Arabs for a previous attack. Saudi influence. Saudi involvement in building mosques around the world can be traced back to the 1960s. The government of Saudi Arabia became a large influence in building foreign mosques only in the last part of the 20th century. In the 1980s, the Saudi Arabian government began to finance the construction of mosques in countries around the world. An estimated US$45 billion has been spent by the Saudi Arabian government financing mosques and Islamic schools in foreign countries. \"Ain al-Yaqeen\", a Saudi newspaper, reported in 2002 that Saudi funds may have helped to build as many as 1,500 mosques and 2,000 other Islamic centers Saudi citizens have also contributed significantly to mosques in the Islamic world, especially in countries where they see Muslims as poor and oppressed. Following the fall of the Soviet Union, in 1992, mosques in impoverished Afghanistan saw many contributions from Saudi citizens. The King Fahd Mosque in Culver City, California and the Islamic Cultural Center of Italy in Rome represent two of Saudi Arabia's largest investments in foreign mosques as former Saudi king Fahd bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud contributed US$8 million and US$50\u00a0million to the two mosques, respectively. Rules and behaviour in mosques. In order to help people keeping focused on worshipping Allah, there are a number of rules that regulate how to behave in a mosque. Some rules are valid all over the world, like the one that says that no shoes should be worn in the prayer hall. There are many rules that are different from mosque to mosque. Prayer leader. It is generally seen as good to have someone who leads the prayers. This is not obligatory, though. The person who usually leads the prayers is called imam. He must be a free and honest man. He should also be an authority when it comes to answering questions on religion. In mosques that were built or that are maintained by the government, the imam is selected by the ruler. In private mosques, the community selects the imam, through majority voting. According to the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence, the man who built the mosque has a stronger claim to the title of imam, but this view is not shared by the other schools. There are three categories of leading prayers, different by the type of prayer: five daily prayers, Friday prayer, or optional prayers. The Hanafi and Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence say that Friday prayers must be led, otherwise they are invalid. Shafi'i and Hanbali schools say that the Friday prayer is valid, as long as it is done in a congregation. Friday prayer can be led by a slave. Scholars disagree on whether a minor can lead Friday prayers. The person appointed to lead the five daily services can lead the Friday prayer as well. Only men may lead prayers in congregations for men. Women are allowed to lead prayers for congregations where there are only women. Washing. All mosques have rules regarding cleanliness. Being clean is an important part of the worshipper's experience. Muslims are required to wash themselves before praying. There is a washing ritual, known as \"wudu\". There are other rules that also apply to those who enter the mosque, even though they do not want to pray there. It is forbidden to wear shoes in the carpeted area of the prayer hall. Some mosques also forbid wearing shoes in other parts, even though these may not be devoted to praying. Those praying and those visiting are expected to be clean. Coming to a mosque after eating something smelly, like garlic, is also undesirable. Dress. Islam requires that its adherents wear clothes that show modesty. As a result, both men and women must follow this rule when they attend a mosque, even though many mosques do not enforce these rules. Men are supposed to come to the mosque wearing loose and clean clothes that do not reveal the shape of the body. Similarly, women who come to the mosque are expected to wear loose clothing, shirts, pants that cover to the wrists and ankles and cover their heads such as with a hijab. Many Muslims, regardless of their ethnic background, wear Middle eastern clothing associated with Arabic Islam to special occasions and prayers at mosques. Concentration. Mosques are places of worship. For this reason, those inside the mosque should be respectful to those who are praying. Loud talking within the mosque, as well as discussion of topics deemed disrespectful, is forbidden in areas where people are praying. It is also disrespectful to walk in front of Muslims in prayer or otherwise disturb them. The walls within the mosque have few items, except for possibly Arabic calligraphy, so Muslims in prayer are not distracted. Muslims are also discouraged from wearing clothing with distracting images and symbols to not divert the attention of those standing behind them during prayer. In many mosques, even the carpeted prayer area has no designs, its plainness helps worshippers focus. Men and women pray in different parts. Islamic law requires men and women to be separated in the prayer hall. Ideally, women should pray behind men. Muhammad said, women should pray at home, rather than at the mosque. Muhammad thought women sohuld not be forbidden in mosques. The second caliph Umar at one time prohibited women from attending mosques especially at night because he feared they may be teased by males, so he required them to pray at home. Sometimes a special part of the mosque was railed off for women; for example, the governor of Mecca in 870 had ropes tied between the columns to make a separate place for women. Many mosques today will put the women behind a barrier or partition or in another room. Mosques in South and Southeast Asia put men and women in separate rooms, as the divisions were built into them centuries ago. In nearly two-thirds of American mosques, women pray behind partitions or in separate areas, not in the main prayer hall; some mosques do not admit women at all. Although there are sections exclusively for women and children, the Grand Mosque in Mecca is desegregated. Non-Muslims in mosques. Under most interpretations of Islamic law, non-Muslims may be allowed into mosques, as long as they do not sleep or eat there; the dissenting opinion is presented by followers of the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence, who argue that non-Muslims may not be allowed into mosques under any circumstances. Different countries have different opinions on the question. With few exceptions, mosques in the Arabian peninsula as well as Morocco do not non-Muslims. For example, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca is one of only two mosques in Morocco currently open to non-Muslims. However, there are also many other places in the west as well as the Islamic world where non-Muslims are welcome to enter mosques. Most mosques in the United States, for example, report receiving non-Muslim visitors every month. Many Mosques throughout the United States welcome non-Muslims as a sign of openness to the rest of the community and to encourage conversions to Islam. In modern-day Saudi Arabia, the Grand Mosque and all of Mecca are open only to Muslims. Likewise, the Masjid al-Nabawi and the city of Medina that surrounds it are also off-limits to those who do not practice Islam. For mosques in other areas, it has most commonly been taken that non-Muslims may only enter mosques if granted permission to do so by Muslims and if they have a legitimate reason. All entrants regardless of religious affiliation are expected to respect the rules and decorum for mosques. In modern Turkey non-Muslim tourists are allowed to enter any mosque, but there are strict rules. Visiting a mosque is allowed only between prayers; visitors are required to wear long trousers and not to wear shoes, women must cover their heads; visitors are not allowed to interrupt praying Muslims, especially by taking photos of them; no loud talk is allowed; and no references to other religions are allowed (no crosses on necklaces, no cross gestures etc.) At different times and places, non-Muslims living under Muslim rule were required to demonstrate deference to mosques. In most cities of Morocco, Jews were required to remove their shoes when passing by a mosque Danish traveler Carsten Niebuhr wrote that in 18th century Egypt Jews and Christians had to dismount before several mosques in veneration of their sanctity. Dogs. Dogs are usually banned from entering mosques, but on September 24, 2008, the Muslim Law Council UK granted a blind Muslim permission to take his guide dog into the mosque via a Fatwa. Mosques as hostel. It is common for a smaller mosque to serve as a hostel for Muslims on \"haj\" (pilgrimage to Mecca). Sometimes mosques are used for refugees, or as temporary homes for homeless people. Obligations to neighbours in Islam are very strict, and specific. The Qur'an says that \"she who is friend to three neighbours will enter Paradise; she who is not, won't,\" along with other commands, such as helping the poor and being nice to people. An important part of being Muslim, or just being part of the mosque, is taking care of people who need help. A mosque is a social group, as well as a religious group. A madrassa is a little different from a mosque. A madrassa focuses on teaching Islam, usually to children and teens. Mosques in Spain. When Spain was under Muslim control, some of the most beautiful buildings were mosques. After 1492, Spain was under Christian control. However, the Christians did not tear down the mosques. They simply put a crucifix in them to make them into churches. These mosques influenced the Renaissance architecture (way of building) in Europe.",
   "Politics": "Politics are the way that people living in groups make decisions. Politics is about making agreements between people so that they can live together in groups such as tribes, cities, or countries. In large groups, such as countries, some people may spend a lot of their time making such agreements. These people are called politicians. Politicians, and sometimes other people, may get together to form a government. The study of politics in universities is called political science, political studies, or public administration. In everyday life, the term \"politics\" refers to the way that countries are governed, and to the ways that governments make rules and laws. But politics can also be seen in other groups, too, such as in big companies, schools, and churches. Governments. One of the ways the government leads the group is by making laws and rules which tell everybody what they can and can not do. The government makes these laws so that society will be safe and well-ordered. The law that \"you must not drink alcohol while driving a car\" stops people from drunk driving, which could kill people. The law \"you must wear a helmet on a motorcycle\" makes sure that people protect themselves. The government can also control people and what happens in a country in other ways besides making laws. Politics is often compared to ethics (ideas about right and wrong). Ethics is a more abstract study of right and wrong. Ethics is usually more concerned with principle than law or politics or diplomacy, so many people think ethics is not practical. But without some agreement on ethics, there is probably no way to even have a public debate, a legal system or an election. There is always some agreement on ethics and personal conduct in a political system. Political parties. In most countries, people have formed political parties to put forward their ideas. There is usually some disagreement between people within a party, but they work together because they feel that they agree on enough things, and they will have more power if they join together. They agree to take the same position on many issues, and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders. An election is usually a competition between different parties. Left-wing and right-wing political parties. University professors of political science and politicians often divide politics into two sides: left-wing politics and right-wing politics. This simplified model helps to explain the main differences of opinion held by different people. A person who believes in right-wing political ideas often believes in moral and social conservatism, law and order, and free trade. A person who believes in left-wing political ideas often believes that the money of a country should be given to the poor people in a country, and that the government should be involved more in the economy. History. The Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote that humans are a political animal and that ethics and politics are closely linked. Niccolo Machiavelli wrote that politics was firstly about having and keeping power. He said that without power, a leader could do nothing. In 1651, Thomas Hobbes wrote \"Leviathan\", a book about politics. Hobbes wrote that people living in groups often give up some of their rights in exchange for some protections from a government. In the 1800s, John Stuart Mill developed the \"liberal\" idea of politics. Mill said that democracy is the most important political development of the 1800s. He said that there should be more protection for individual rights against the government. Bernard Crick wrote a list of the political virtues, which were about best practices of politics itself. International politics. There are also disagreements between different countries. Attempts to solve the problem with meetings and negotiations are then called diplomacy. This is just politics between nations instead of politics within nations. If the problems are very serious, and they are not resolved by diplomatic meetings they can lead to war.",
   "Multiverse": "A multiverse (or meta-universe) is the set of multiple possible universes, including our universe, which comprise reality. It is believed that our universe is perfect for life, because it had thousands of other chances at life, shown by the multiple universes in the multiverse.",
   "Glow-worm": "A glow-worm, or glowworm, is an insect. Other names for glow-worms are fire-fly and lightning bug. Glow worms are beetles (one is a fly, Arachnocampa). They are nocturnal. They are active during the night. They have special organs that can produce light. This is used to find mates. The patterns in which the beetles flash is unique per species.",
   "Indian Ocean": "The Indian Ocean is the ocean surrounded by Asia to the north, Australia and the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Southern Ocean to the south, and Africa and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. It is so named because the south Asian country of India is located on its shore. The Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea are all parts of this ocean. The deepest point in the Indian Ocean is located in Java Trench, it is 25,344 feet deep. The avrage depth is 13,002 feet deep. The Indian Ocean is 28,350,000 square miles in size.",
   "Crusade": "When the Crusades happened, Muslims controlled the Holy Land. The Holy Land is a place that is very important for the three major monotheistic religions: Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. There are many important religious sites in the Holy Land. This is the land now called Israel or Palestine. Muslims got control of Nazareth, Bethlehem and other religious sites during the Caliphate of Omar (634-44). (A Caliph is a kind of religious and political leader in an Islamic state.) Many Crusades. There were many different crusades. The most important and biggest Crusades happened from the 11th century to the 13th century. There were 9 big Crusades in this time. They are numbered 1 through 9. There were also many smaller Crusades. Some crusades were even within Europe (for example, in Spain and France). The smaller Crusades continued to the 16th century, until the Renaissance and Reformation. The word \"Crusade\" is related to the word \"Cross\", and means a Christian holy war. There is also the Arabic word \"Jihad\", referring to a holy war fought by Muslims. All sides (Christians, Muslims, and Jews) believed very much in their religions. They also had political reasons for fighting. The strong belief made people less able to understand other people during times when there was no peace. The Crusades and Jihads caused very much loss of life and property for all sides. Much of the conflict between religions today is still partly from the Crusades and Jihads. The Crusades led to the bloodshed of many innocent people and it affected peoples views forever (Dr. Omar Hajjar of Columbia). First Crusade. When Alexius I called for help to defend his empire against theSeljuk Turks, in 1095 Pope Urban II asked all Christians to join a war against the Turks. The Pope told the Christians that fighting the war would repay God for their sins. The Christian soldiers were called \"crusaders\". The armies marched to Jerusalem, attacking several cities on their way. In 1099 they won the battle for Jerusalem, and killed many. As a result of the First Crusade, several small countries were created. One was named the Kingdom of Jerusalem. A main cause of the crusade was the desperate need for land and retaking Jerusalem gave them both their Holy Land and land to live on. Second Crusade. After some years of peace, a man named St Bernard of Clairvaux called for a new crusade when the town of Edessa was attacked by the Turks. French and German armies marched to Asia in 1147, but failed to win. Third Crusade. In 1187, Saladin recaptured Jerusalem. Pope Gregory VIII started a new crusade, led by several of Europe's kings: Philip II of France, Richard I of England and Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor. Frederick drowned in Cilicia in 1190. Richard left in 1192 after agreeing to stop the fighting with Saladin. On Richard's way home, his ship was wrecked, leading him to Austria. In Austria his enemy Duke Leopold captured him, and Richard was held. Fourth Crusade. The Fourth Crusade was started by Pope Innocent III in 1202, with the idea to attack the Holy Land through Egypt. The Venetians changed this crusade, and went to the Christian city of Constantinople, where they attempted to place a Byzantine exile on the throne. After a series of misunderstandings and outbreaks of violence, the city was sacked in 1204. Albigensian Crusade. The Albigensian Crusade was started in 1209 to eliminate the Cathars of southern France. Established view. The Children's Crusade is a crusade of 1212. The story is that an outburst of the old popular enthusiasm led a gathering of children in France and Germany. A boy, from either France or Germany said that Jesus had visited him, and told him to peacefully convert Muslims to Christianity. Following this vision, many children formed bands, and marched to Italy. There, they were put onto ships which either capsized in a storm, or which went to Morocco, where the children were sold into slavery. There are several versions of the story. This had led some people to believe that this did not really happen. More recent research. It looks like there were really two groups of people who moved, in 1212. Both movements were very similar. For this reason, those who wrote the chronicles put them together, as a single movement. In the first movement, Nicholas, a shepherd from Germany, led a group across the Alps and into Italy in the early spring of 1212. About 7,000 arrived in Genoa in late August. However, their plans didn't bear fruit when the waters failed to part as promised and the band broke up. Some left for home, others may have gone to Rome, while still others may have travelled down the Rh\u00f4ne to Marseille where they were probably sold into slavery. Few returned home and none reached the Holy Land. The second movement was led by a \"shepherd boy\" named Stephen de Cloyes near the village of Ch\u00e2teaudun. In June of that year, the boy said that he had a letter for the king of France from Jesus. He could gather a crowd of over 30,000 and went to Saint-Denis. There he was seen to work miracles. On the orders of Philip II, on the advice of the University of Paris, the crowd was sent home, and most of them went. None of the contemporary sources mentions plans of the crowd to go to Jerusalem. Later chroniclers elaborated on these events. Recent research suggests those taking part were not children, at least not the very young. In the early 1200s, bands of wandering poor started cropping up throughout Europe. These were people displaced by economic changes at the time which forced many poor peasants in northern France and Germany to sell their land. These bands were referred to as \"pueri\" (Latin for \"boys\") in a condescending manner, in much the same way that people from rural areas in the United States are called \"country boys.\" In 1212, a young French \"puer\" named Stephen and a German \"puer\" named Nicholas separately began claiming that they had each had similar visions of Jesus. This resulted in these bands of roving poor being united into a religious protest movement which transformed this forced wandering into a religious journey. The \"pueri\" marched, following the Cross. They associated themselves with Jesus's biblical journey. This, however, was not a prelude to a holy war. At that time, chronicles were mostly kept by the Catholic church. They were written in Latin. Thirty years later, chroniclers read the accounts of these processions and translated \"pueri\" as \"children\" without understanding the usage. So, the Children's Crusade was born. The resulting story illustrates how ingrained the concept of Crusading was in the people of that time\u2014 the chroniclers assumed that the pueri must have been Crusaders. In their innocence, they returned to the foundations of crusading characteristic of Peter the Hermit, and met the same sort of tragic fate. According to Matthew Paris, one of the leaders of the Children's Crusade became \"Le Ma\u00eetre de Hongrie,\" the leader of the Shepherds' Crusade in 1251. Fifth Crusade. The Church tried another crusade to attack the Holy Land. A crusading force from Hungary, Austria, and Bavaria captured Damietta, a city in Egypt, in 1219. The crusaders had to surrender, due to a losing the battle for Cairo. Sixth Crusade. In 1228, Emperor Frederick II set sail from Brindisi for Syria. He did this after the Pope excommunicated him. By talking to the Turks he had success, and Jerusalem, Nazareth, and Bethlehem was given to the Crusaders for ten years without fighting. This was the first major crusade not initiated by the Papacy, a trend that was to continue for the rest of the century. Seventh Crusade. The Templars argued with Egypt in 1243. In 1244, Egypt attacked Jerusalem. Louis IX of France started a crusade against Egypt from 1248 to 1254. It was a failure, and Louis spent much of the crusade living in Acre. In the midst of this crusade was the first Shepherds' Crusade in 1251. Eighth Crusade. The Eighth Crusade was organized by Louis IX in 1270, to help the Crusader states in Syria. However, the crusade was diverted to Tunis, where Louis spent only two months before dying. Ninth Crusade. Before he was king, Edward I of England started a crusade in 1271. He retired the following year after a truce. The Crusader states lost everything after this.",
   "Cricket": "Cricket is a sport. It is played between two teams of eleven players each who score runs (points) by running between two sets of three small, wooden posts called wickets. Each of the wickets is at one end of a rectangle of flattened grass called the pitch. Around the pitch is a much larger oval of grass called the cricket ground. The main rules of cricket. There are two teams. The team bowling has 11 players on the field. The team batting always has two people on the field. The Captain of the bowling team chooses a bowler from his team; the other 10 players are called fielders. The bowler is trying to aim the ball at a wicket, which is made up of three sticks (called stumps) stuck into the earth, with two small sticks (called bails) balanced on them. One of the fielders, called the wicket keeper, stands behind the wicket to catch the ball if the bowler misses the wicket. The other fielders chase the ball after the batter has hit it. The bowler throws (bowls) the ball overarm six times, which is called an over; then another player becomes the bowler for the next over, and bowls from the other end, and so on. The same bowler cannot bowl two overs one after the other. The batter is trying to defend the wicket with his bat. When he hits the ball with his bat, he runs toward the other wicket that the bowler or the other batsman is standing at. To score a run, the two batsmen must both run from their wicket to the other wicket, as many times as they can. If the ball leaves the field after being hit without bouncing, six runs are scored. If the ball rolls or bounces out, whether or not the batter hit it, it counts as four runs. Where cricket is played. Cricket is popular in many countries, mostly in Commonwealth countries. The countries where cricket is most popular compete in international matches (games between countries) that last up to 5 days, which are called Test Matches; those countries are India, Australia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, South Africa, New Zealand, Zimbabwe and England, as well as a group of Caribbean countries that play together as a team called the West Indies. Cricket is also played in Kenya, Canada, Bermuda, Ireland, Scotland, and various European and Asian countries; the national teams of those countries can play one-day international matches, but are not allowed to play Test Matches. Averages. For a famous example of a batting average, see Don Bradman.",
   "Andorra": "Andorra is a European country between Spain and France. There are about 70,000 people living in the country. The capital is Andorra la Vella. It is ruled by a Spanish Bishop and the French President. Andorra's government is a parliamentary democracy.",
   "Male": "Male is one of the two sexes. Most species have two sexes - male and female. Human males are men or boys; human females are women or girls. The two sexes have different sexual organs They also often have different functions. The female gives birth to children with the semen provided by the male. In many human societies, females often were involved in gathering, while men used to hunt. Nowadays, we find that females are just as good as males at doing most tasks.",
   "Vector": "A vector is a mathematical object that has a size and direction. A vector can be used to show distance and direction. Vectors can be used to show how fast something is moving and in what direction. Vectors can also be used to show many other things. The simplest picture of a vector is a line segment, with a starting point and an ending point. Examples of nonvectors. Sometimes, only a number for the size is needed. However, the direction is also needed sometimes.",
   "Seam ripper": "A seam ripper is a cutting tool. It is used for removing stitches in sewing and cutting open buttonholes made on a sewing machine. Sometimes it is also called a thread ripper. The tool usually has a handle, shaft, and head. The head has two points: one flattened to form a pointed blade and the other forming a small point. To use a seam ripper to remove sewn threads, the blade is placed underneath the thread to be cut. The thread slips down between the two points, and the tool is then lifted upwards allowing the blade to cut through the thread. Then the loose thread ends can be removed.",
   "Spain": "Spain is a country in the southwest of Europe. It is in the Iberian Peninsula near Portugal and Gibraltar. France and the little country of Andorra are on its northeast side, where the Pyrenees mountains are. The people of Spain are called \"Spaniards\". Most people there speak Spanish, \"Espa\u00f1ol\" in Spanish, but there are other languages in different parts of the country. They are Catalan, Basque, and Galician, Leonese, Aragonese, Aranese Occitan and even Portuguese. The religion of most of the people in Spain is Roman Catholic. Since 1975, Spain has had a king, who only does what the constitution allows him to. For example the king formally declares a war, but only if the Government asks him to do so. The parliament is called \"Las Cortes Generales\", and has two bodies: \"El Congreso\" and \"El Senado\" and it is chosen by the Spanish people by voting. This kind of government is called a constitutional monarchy. The King of Spain is called Juan Carlos I. The President of the executive branch of the government is Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero. The government and the king's palace are in Madrid, the capital of Spain. Spain has more than five hundred thousand square kilometres of land. It is smaller than France, but it is bigger than Sweden or Germany. Around forty-three million people live in Spain. Spain has 17 parts called autonomous communities (this means that they can decide upon some affairs themselves). Each part has its own government. Early history. People have lived in Spain for a long time. There have been people living there since the Stone Age. The first references to Spain are in the Bible. Some of the first people to live there were Iberians and Celts, and the Phoenicians made a few cities there to get tin and silver to trade. Later, the Roman Empire controlled Spain for about five hundred years; then as the Roman Empire broke up, groups of Germanic people called Visigoths moved into Spain and took it over. Muslim occupation. In the 700s, Arabic people took over, and later groups from North Africa, called the Moors, ruled most of Spain for eight hundred years. They were Muslims, and Muslim Spain was the farthest western point of Islamic civilization. This civilization was quite advanced at architecture and urban planning. The Moors were very wealthy because they controlled the gold trade from the Ghana Empire in West Africa. They built many beautiful buildings, especially in the south of the country, a place called Al-Andalus. People can see many of their buildings still standing in cities in Andalusia, such as Seville, Granada, and Cordoba. Muslim Spain was multicultural and tolerant with Jews, Christians and Muslims living side by side. There was also a huge Slavic population (\"saqaliba\") near the Mediterranean coast, at first brought in to be slaves, but many Slavic generals rose to become rulers of their own cities (\"taifas\") for a short time as the Caliphate of Cordoba fell apart in the early 11th century. Muslim Spain was focused on learning - the greatest library system outside Baghdad was also there. 1492. The Christian kingdoms that were still in the North of Spain fought to take the rest Spain again from the Muslims. They fought wars for many hundreds of years, and slowly pushed the border farther south. Many Christians from the north of Spain and Europe moved into the areas they won. In the year 1492, they took the last part of Spain that still belonged to the Moors, Granada. Boabdil, the last Moorish King of Granada, surrendered to King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella of Castile on 2 January 1492. It was Ferdinand and Isabella of Castile who now ruled all of Spain. Before this, there were a number of Christian countries in what is now called Spain. Two of these countries, Castile and Aragon, came together when Ferdinand II of Aragon married the queen Isabella of Castile. It is very important to know that the King ruled as much as the Queen. In the same year, 1492, they sent Christopher Columbus to sail across the Atlantic Ocean. Columbus found the islands of the Caribbean Sea. When other European sailors explored more, they found out that there were two continents there - North America and South America. Spain sent many soldiers and businessmen to North and South America, and they took over very large parts of those two continents. This empire did not make Spain a rich country, for most of the money had to be spent in wars. Many of these wars were fought against other European countries who were trying to take over parts of the Americas. Meanwhile, at home, the Muslim manuscripts had been either burnt or taken to other countries. Jews had also been expelled from Spain. Some Jews remained but they had to become Christians. Among the few things kept and respected in Spain were in music: harmony and stringed instruments. The buildings that had been built by the Moors were kept, and many Muslim religious buildings (mosques) were turned into churches. Some Jewish religious buildings were also turned into churches. Many Arab words became part of the Spanish Language. 16th and 17 century. The Emperor of Austria, Charles the V became the King of Spain and Portugal too. So the empire became bigger than ever. However it was not a single countries but many independent countries with a single King. At first many Spaniards did not want that Charles the V were their king, so they fought against him. But the King won. Charles the V involved Spain in many wars to defend his Austrian empire. 18th century. In the 18th century some of the parts of that large empire became their own countries, or were taken over by new countries, such as the United States of America. 19th century. Spain (and other European countries) was invaded by Napoleon of France. Spain, Britain and Europe sent its troops to defend the peninsula, since it was so weak. 20th century. There was not much peace in Spain during the first part of the 20th century. Some Spaniards tried to set up a government chosen by the people (a democracy), and they made the King of Spain leave the country. However, in 1936, two different groups of Spaniards went to war over whether the government should be a democracy (although those on the side of the Republic were largely socialist or anarchist), or take orders from one person. In 1939, those who wanted democracy were defeated, and a nationalist dictator named Francisco Franco took over the government. Franco died in 1975. He had decided that Spain should have a monarchy again, and he chose Juan Carlos, the grandson of the king who had been forced to leave the country, to be king. But the king did not rule as a dictator; instead, he chose to set up a democracy. Now Spain is a modern democratic country, and does business with many countries around the world. It is the eighth economy of the world and is an important part of the European Union. Geography of Spain. The middle of Spain is a high, dry, flat land called La Meseta. In La Meseta it can be very hot in the summer and cold or very cold in the winter. Spain also has many mountain ranges. On the south coast, the weather is warm and \"temperate\" - temperate weather is neither very hot nor very cold. Since Spain is in the south of Europe, it is very sunny. Many people from Northern Europe take their vacations in Spain, enjoying its beaches and cities.",
   "Albania": "Albania is a country in Southeastern Europe. The capital is Tirana. About 3.6 million people live in Albania. Albania is next to Serbia (Kosovo), Montenegro, Greece and Macedonia. It has a coast on the Adriatic Sea in the west, and a coast on the Ionian Sea in the southwest. The official language is Albanian. The national anthem is \"Hymni i Flamurit\".",
   "Summer": "Summer is one of four seasons. It is the hottest and one of the most dry seasons of the year. Four seasons are found in areas which are not too hot or too cold. Summer happens to the north and south sides of the Earth at opposite times of the year. In the Northern Hemisphere, summer takes place between the months of June and September and in the Southern Hemisphere, it takes place between December and March. This is because when the Northern Hemisphere, or part, of the Earth points towards the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere points away.",
   "Star": "A star is a big ball in outer space that is made of very hot plasma (which is like a gas). Stars get energy using nuclear fusion so they can make light, making them look like they are on fire. Most stars look like shiny dots from Earth, because they are far away, and Earth's atmosphere (the air) makes it harder to see them well. Our Sun is the closest star to us. The earth moves around (\"orbits\") the Sun in an oval shape. The Sun and all things that orbit it are called the Solar System. Many other stars sometimes have planets orbiting them too. Scientists have found other planets moving around other stars, but no planets that they have found are similar to Earth. The nearest star to our Solar System, and the second nearest star to Earth after the Sun, is Proxima Centauri. It is 39.9 trillion kilometres away. This is 4.2 light years away, meaning that light from Proxima Centauri takes 4.2 years to reach Earth. Astronomers think there are a very large number of stars in the Universe. They estimate (guess) that there are at least 70 sextillion stars. That is 70,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, which is about 230 billion times the amount of stars in the Milky Way (our galaxy). Most stars are very old. They are usually thought to be between 1 and 10 billion years old. The oldest stars are thought to be around 13.7 billion years old. That is the age of the Universe, scientists think. Some stars are small, and some stars are big. The smallest neutron stars (which are actually dead stars) are no bigger than a city. The neutron star is incredibly dense. If you were to take a layer a micron thick and apply it onto a tank, it would be an inpenetratable coat of armor. This is not possible because the tank is now so heavy, it will sink into the center of the Earth.Supergiant stars are the largest objects in the Universe. They have a diameter about 1,000 times bigger than the Sun (the orbit of jupiter). They are about 1.6 billion kilometers across. The star Polaris (the North Star), and the star Betelgeuse, in the Orion constellation are supergiant stars. The light, heat, and other energy of stars comes from nuclear fusion -- a process of turning one chemical element into another one. Most stars are mostly made of hydrogen and helium. They turn the hydrogen into helium. (When a star is near the end of its life, it begins to change the helium into other chemical elements, like carbon and oxygen). Fusion produces a lot of energy. The energy makes the star very hot. The energy produced by stars radiates away from them. It is electromagnetic radiation. This is mostly visible light. When seen in the night sky without a telescope, some stars appear brighter than other stars. This difference is called apparent magnitude. There are two reasons for stars to differ in apparent magnitude. If one star is much closer than another otherwise similar star, it will appear much brighter, in just the same way that a candle that is near looks brighter than a big fire that is far away. If one star is much larger or much hotter than another star at about the same distance, it will appear much brighter, in just the same way that if two fires are the same distance away, the bigger or hotter one will look brighter. Beside light, stars also give off a solar wind and neutrinos. These are very small particles. Stars are a source of a gravity field. This is what keeps planets close to them. It is also not unusual for two stars to orbit each other. This happens when they are close together. This is also because of gravity, in the same way as the Earth orbits the Sun. These binary stars (binary meaning \"two\") are thought to be very common. There are even groups of three or more stars orbiting each other. Proxima Centauri is the smallest star in a group of three. Stars are not spread evenly across all of space. They are grouped into galaxies. A typical galaxy contains hundreds of billions of stars. Birth and life. People think that stars are made in nebulas. These are big areas of slightly higher density than normal space. When very big stars die, they explode. This is called a supernova. When a supernova happens in a nebula, it becomes unstable. This makes parts of the nebula collapse. Stars form in these collapsed areas. The Orion Nebula is an example of a place where stars form. Stars spend about 90% of their lives fusing hydrogen to produce helium in high pressure reactions near the core. Such stars are said to be on the main sequence. Small stars (called red dwarfs) burn their fuel very slowly and might last tens to hundreds of billions of years. At the end of their lives, they become dimmer and dimmer. Because most stars use up their supply of hydrogen, their outer layers expand and cool to form a red giant. (Astrophysicists think that in about 5 billion years, when the sun is a red giant.) Eventually the core is compressed enough to start helium fusion, and the star heats up and contracts. (Larger stars will also fuse heavier elements, all the way to iron.) An average-size star will then shed its outer layers as a \"planetary nebula\". The core that remains will be a tiny ball of degenerate matter, not heavy enough for further fusion to take place, supported only by its own pressure, called a white dwarf. It will fade into a black dwarf over very, very long stretches of time. In larger stars, fusion continues until collapse ends up causing the star to explode in a supernova. This is the only cosmic process that happens on human timescales; historically, supernovae have been observed as \"new stars\" where none existed before. Most of the matter in a star is blown away in the explosion (forming nebulae such as the Crab Nebula) but what remains will collapse into a neutron star (a pulsar or X-ray burster) or, in the case of the largest stars, a black hole. The blown-off outer layers includes heavy elements, which are often converted into new stars and/or planets. The flowing out of the gas from supernovae and the stellar wind of large stars play an important part in shaping the interstellar medium. formula_1",
   "Million": "A million (1,000,000) is a large number. It is one thousand thousands.",
   "Earth": "orbit: 149,600,000 km (1.00 AU) from Sun Earth is the third planet from the Sun. It is one of the four \"terrestrial\" planets in the Solar System meaning it has a mostly solid surface. The other three are Mercury, Venus and Mars. It is often called \"The Earth\", \"Planet Earth\", \"the World\" \"Terra\", and \"home\". Earth is home to millions of species of plants and animals, including humans. Earth is the only place in the universe where life is known to exist. Science shows that the Earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago. The things that live on Earth have completely changed its air or atmosphere. This is called a biosphere. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered in salt water oceans. Earth is the only place in the universe where liquid water is known to exist. The other 29% is made of rocky land in the shape of continents and islands. Earth interacts with other objects in the Solar System, specifically the Sun and the Moon.The Earth orbits or goes around the Sun roughly once every 365.25 days. One spin is called a \"day\" and one orbit around the Sun is called a year. This is why we have 365 days in year. Earth has only one moon, known as the Moon. History. Scientists think that the Earth and the other planets formed about 4.5 billion years ago. They were made of the leftover gas from the nebula that made the Sun. Some scientists think that the Moon might have been made when a small planet, sometimes called \"Theia\", crashed into Earth and bit broke off - making the Moon. Condensing water vapour or steam, comets and asteroids hiting the Earth made the oceans. Within a billion years the first life evolved. Some life developed photosynthesis which lets plants make food from the Sun's light. This released a lot of oxygen into the atmosphere or air, making the Earth's surface suitable for life. This oxygen also formed the ozone layer which protects the Earth from bad ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. This protection made it possible for things to move from the deep ocean to the surface. This long ago almost all land was in one place, called a \"supercontinent\". The earliest known supercontinent was called \"Rodina\". Scientists think that soon after this there was a time when the Earth was almsot entirely covered by glaciers. This is called \"Snowball Earth\" What it is made of. Earth is terrestrial planet. This means it is made up of solid rock unlike a gas giant such as Jupiter. It is the largest out of the four terrestrial planets in mass and diameter. Earth also has the strongest gravitational and magnetic field. Shape. The Earth's shape is an oblate spheroid. This means it is basically a sphere but it bulges around the middle. The average width of the Earth is approx. 40,000\u00a0kilometres (40,030.229\u00a0kilometres) divided by pi. This is because originally one metre was defined as one 10,000,000th of the distance from the North pole to the equator, through Paris, France. The highest point on Earth is the peak of Mount Everest at 8,848 m above sea level. The lowest natural point is the bottom of the Mariana Trench at 10,911 metres below sea level. Becuase of the bulge at the middle or the equator, the farthest point from the Earth's centre is the top of Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador Internal Structure. Inside the Earth is similar to the other terrestrial planets. It has an outer, solid rock layer called the crust. Everything that lives on Earth is on top of the crust. Underneath that is a layer of thick, liquid rock called the mantle. Under that is a thin liquid layer called the outer core and then the solid iron inner core. The thickness of the crust changes. On land the average is between 30-50 kilometres thick. Under the oceans in some places it is only 6 kilometres thick. The inside of the Earth is very hot, the outer core may be as much as 7000 degrees. Tectonic Plates. According to plate tectonics the Earth's crust basically \"floats\" on the thick liquid rock of the mantle below. The crust is split up into parts called \"plates\". These plates interact as they move about causing earthquakes and creating volcanoes and mountain ranges. The place where plates meet are called plate boundaries. There are three types of plate boundary: \"constructive\", \"destructive\" and \"transform\". Surface. The Earth changes greatly from place to place. Over 70% of the Earth surface is covered by water. The underwater surface has many of the same features as the above sea with volcanos, mountains and trenches or canyons. The 30% not covered by water is mostly forests, deserts, plains, mountains and plateaus. Human civilisation has led to increasing urbanisation - the growth of cities. Hydrosphere. All the water on Earth, on land or in the atmosphere, is part of the \"hydrosphere\". No other planet humans know of has a hydrosphere. About 97.5% of all water is salt water. About half the fresh water is currently ice. The oceans absorb or soak up carbon dioxide, a gas that adds to the greenhouse effect and global warming. Atmosphere. A planet's atmosphere is a layer of different gases surrounding it. It is kept there by gravity. The Earth's atmosphere is made of roughly 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and small amounts of other gases. This mixture is often called \"air\". Farther up there is a layer of ozone gas called the \"Ozone layer\". Ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. Ultraviolet radiation is dangerous to people, so without the Ozone layer life wouldn't be possible. The atmosphere also protects the earth from crashes with meteors and small asteroids. This is because they burn up due to all the friction as they fly through it. It also helps to keep Earth warm. Some gases including carbon dioxide and methane act like a blanket around the Earth, they trap heat under them, keeping the Earth warm. This is called the \"greenhouse effect\" When humans build factories and power plants to make electricity we burn things. When we burn things it lets out a lot of carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide goes up into the atmosphere and traps more heat. This is called \"global warming\". It might be very dangerous for life on Earth if this continues. Weather, Climate and the water Cycle. Hot air rises. As it rises it gets colder again and falls. This is called \"convection currents\" When hot air meets cold air different weather effects happen. \"Convection currents\" are the cause of almost all weather on Earth. When it gets hot on the surface water evaporates and becomes steam or water vapour. This hot water vapour rises. As it rises it gets colder. When gets cold enough it turns back into water again. This causes the clouds and rain. It is called the water cycle. Orbit and Rotation. The Earth takes about 24 hours to rotate or spin around once. This is called a day. Earth takes roughly 365 days to go around the Sun. This is called a year. The Earth is, on average, 150 million miles away from the Sun, and moving at a speed of 30 kilometers a second or 108,000 miles an hour. The Moon orbits the Earth at an average distance of 250,000 miles. It is tidally locked to Earth, which means it always has the same side facing the Earth. It takes roughly one month to complete one orbit. Only six people in history have ever seen the other side of the Moon. The Earth is part of the Solar System and orbits the sun along with thousands of small objects and eight planets. The Sun and therefore the Solar System are currently traveling through the Orion Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy and will be for the next 10,000 years or so.",
   "Tributary": "A tributary of a river is another river that flows into it. If one river flows into a second river, then the first river is a tributary of the second river. For example, in the United States the Missouri River flows into the Mississippi River. That means the Missouri River is a tributary of the Mississippi River. A river and all its tributaries form the catchment of that river. A watershed separates the catchments of separate rivers.",
   "Buddha": "A Buddha is a very holy person in Buddhism. The word \"Buddha\" means \"He woke up\" in Sanskrit. Buddha was named Siddhartha Gautama. He was the man who started Buddhism. Sometimes people call him \"the Buddha\". Other times, people call any person a Buddha if they have found enlightenment. If a person has not found enlightenment yet, but is very close to reaching it, then he is called Bodhisattva. In early Buddhism Buddha meant only Siddhartha Gautama. Later an idea began that there could be many Buddhas: some in the past, some maybe in the present and some in the future. Since Buddhism tradition thinks Buddha is an ideal person, tradition reached a notion of 36 ideal features of Buddhas. Some of those features are represented on statues of Buddhas. Some other features, like the feature of their foot, are difficult to be represented on a statue. Buddhists believe that the Buddha was enlightened, which means that he knew all about how to live a peaceful life and how to not to suffer in an afterlife. They think he never got depressed, frustrated, upset or confused. He is said to have never argued with other people, but just said what was true and useful, out of compassion. Some Buddhists pray to Buddhas, but Buddhas are not gods. Buddhas are just teachers, to help people who will listen. A Buddha is a human being who has woken up and can see the true way the world works. This knowledge totally changes the person beyond birth, death, and rebirth. Nothing can annoy him anymore, even the circulation of incarnation, since his enlightenment put him outsides of this eternity circle in time and space. This person can help others become enlightened too in a proper way. There are ideas which are said to lead someone to enlightenment. They are called the \"Dharma\", meaning the way or the truth. Anyone can become a Buddha, it is said, but it is very hard. Age and gender do not matter. Buddhists believe there have been many Buddhas who were alone, called \"pacceka-buddhas\". They reached \"enlightenment\" on their own, but they did not teach others. The first Buddha was afraid to teach people too. Their poor understanding made them hard to teach. But he did teach people, and people followed him. To learn more about the Buddha most people know as the only Buddha, read: Siddhartha Gautama. To learn more about what the Buddhas teach, read: Buddhism.",
   "Constitution": "The constitution of a country (or a state) is a special type of law that tells how its government is supposed to work. It tells how the country's leaders are to be chosen and how long they get to stay in office, how new laws are made and old laws are to be changed or removed, what kind of people are eligible to vote and what other rights they are guaranteed, and how the constitution can be changed. Limits are put on the Government in how much power they have within the Constitution \"(see Rule of Law)\". On the other hand, countries with repressive or corrupt governments frequently do not stick to their constitutions, or have bad constitutions. This can be known as dictatorship or simply \"bending the rules\". A Constitution is often a way of a uniting within a Federation. Scholars don't agree whether the UK has a Constitution or not. There is a debate because the UK has parts of its Constitution codified (written) and uncodified (not written). If the constitution is uncodified, then sources for the agreement are still accessible, they are just written in different various political books or tradition, instead of written all in one place like a codified Constitution. History. The Magna Carta of England, written in 1215, was an early type of constitution. The first modern constitution in the world was that of the United States in 1787, but some Native American tribes had similar charters before that. The U.S. has one of the oldest constitutions that people are still using, and it has been changed (amended) many times over the years. It was made after the colonists won their independence from Britain. At first they had the Articles of Confederation but the Articles seemed too weak so they were replaced with today's Constitution...",
   "Graph theory": "Graph Theory is about analyzing Graphs. A graph is a group of points and lines connecting each other, to make a picture of such a route. It is less detailed than a map and is used to find answers. Graph theory in perspective. Graph theory is an important part of mathematics and computer science. To many such problems, exact solutions do exist. Many times however, they are very hard to calculate. Therefore, very often, approximations are used. There are two kinds of such approximations, Monte-Carlo algorithms and Las-Vegas algorithms. Graphs are normally represented by two different sets, typically set a graph G would be represented as the collection of the sets V and E. The set V is a discrete set containing all vertices of the graph. The set E is a binary set, whose pairwise elements are elements of set V. Each pair in set E represents an edge connecting two vertices. If for all elements v1 and v2 of the set V, if and are both elements of E then the graph G is considered a Complete Graph. I would move forth to define a Path, a Walk, A weighted graph, a directional graph. Then make a comment about how all trees are just subsets of graphs. It could also be proven that all connected graphs may be represented as a Tree. There is more to graph theory than explained here.",
   "Gun": "A gun is a machine used to shoot bullets. Guns are also called \"firearms\". They can be of many different sizes: small enough to hold in one hand, or large enough to fire shells to sink a warship. Guns that are small enough to be carried and used by one person all have the same basic parts: a trigger, a barrel, and a handle. The trigger is pulled by a finger to fire the bullet. The barrel guides the bullet. The handle is held by the human who will fire the gun. In military terms, the word \"firearm\" is usually used for the type of weapons that soldiers carry (pistols and rifles), while the word \"gun\" is used for larger guns that fire at higher speed. The weapons on warships and tanks are called \"guns\" or \"turrets\" (if placed on a rotating base), not \"firearms\". Guns are very effective weapons. Guns guide bullets at a very high speed which is much more deadly than a traditional arrow. Bullets are contained within \"rounds\", also known as \"cartridges\". A cartridge consists of a \"bullet\", a \"casing\", \"Propellant\" and a \"primer\". \"Cartridges\" have different ways of being loaded into different kinds of weapons. Cartridges can be loaded directly into a firearm or into a \"clip\", a \"magazine\" or other bullet container which is loaded into the firearm. Some firearms have their rounds loaded into the \"stock (or butt)\" of the weapon. A \"clip\" is loaded with rounds and the \"clip\" is loaded into a weapon. The \"magazine\" is a container for the rounds which has a spring that moves the bullets into place for firing. Firearms known as \"revolvers\" have a cylinder with holes that the bullets are loaded into. Modern guns are usually loaded with a \"magazine\" and are called \"automatic loading\". Use of firearms. Firearms are designed to kill. Most firearms are designed to kill people. Some kinds of firearms, such as hunting rifles, are designed to kill other animals. A deer hunter usually shoots a deer with a rifle. Some people also use firearms for shooting sports, usually known as \"target shooting\". \"Target Shooting\" is an Olympic sport. Guns are the main weapons used by armies. In modern armies every soldier has a firearm as part of his or her equipment which they are taught to use and keep in good working order. Guns have been used by armies since about 900 AD when the Chinese began using cannons. Cannons were used in European armies and on battleships by 1500. Long barreled guns called muskets, that could be carried and used by one person, were used in China by the 1300s. Guns were not an important weapon in European armies until the 1600s. Because guns are weapons that are made to kill, many countries only allow soldiers, policemen, (and in some countries, noblemen) to have them. In many countries a person must have a special permit (or license) if they want to own a gun. Depending on the gun, people need to be a certain age and may need to meet other criteria to get such a permit. In United States and other countries, people can buy guns and use them for self-defense, sport such as hunting, target shooting and target practice. In some countries, such as Australia, people on farms are allowed to keep guns but it is difficult for a city person to own a gun without a good reason.",
   "Epiphany": "Epiphany is a Web browser for GNOME. It is also available for Mac OS X and was made from Galeon. It uses the Gecko layout engine from the Mozilla project to show web pages; however, the Epiphany developers have a new but less stable version of Epiphany 2.21.4 using the WebKit engine instead of Gecko. The Epiphany team wants to stop using Gecko and only use the WebKit engine, by the time they release Epiphany 2.24 or 2.26.

   "Taiwan": "Taiwan (Traditional Chinese: \u81fa\u7063 or \u53f0\u7063, Simplified Chinese: \u53f0\u6e7e, Pinyin: Taiwan) is a democratic island country, officially known as the Republic of China (Taiwan) in East Asia. It is southeast of the communist People's Republic of China (PRC), south of Japan, and north of the Philippines. It includes the Pescadores islands. They are located nearby. Taiwan's old name was Formosa. It means \"beautiful island\" in Portuguese. The largest cities on Taiwan are the capital of Taipei and Kaohsiung. Most people living in Taiwan (sometimes called Taiwanese) are Han. There are also Taiwanese Aborigines who lived on Taiwan before the Han came to live there. Taiwan has three large Han groups. They are different in language and places where their ancestors came from: the Southern Fujianese (from China's Fujian Province), the Hakka (from China), and Mainlanders (from Mainland China after 1948). these so-called \"Han\" were really Taiwanese Aborigines who were forced to become like Chinese by the Qing Dynasty. The communist People's Republic of China (PRC) says that Taiwan belongs to them, and does not think the Republic of China (Taiwan) has a right to exist as a country. But most Taiwanese citizens think the ROC (Taiwan) does not belong to the People's Republic of China and that the ROC (Taiwan) is a free country. Still others think that Taiwan should change their name to the \"Republic of Taiwan\" instead of using the current name Republic of China (Taiwan). Status of Taiwan. There are two Chinese governments in the world: The People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC). PRC claims control over the island of Taiwan (which is also known as Taiwan province). Today, in reality, the PRC government controls mainland China, and the ROC government governs Taiwan. The PRC government has never occupied Taiwan. The ROC government occupied mainland China from 1911 to 1949, before losing control of mainland China to the communist PRC. Today, people who live in Taiwan have different ideas. Many Taiwanese think there is no freedom in China. Although some people on the island want to be united again with China, others want Taiwan to formally declare independence. But most of the people in Taiwan want to keep everything like it is now, at least until China becomes free. Today most countries of the world recognize the People's Republic of China as China. Even though Taiwan is not recognized by UN as a sovereign nation, most countries still have very close economic and cultural relationship with the island of Taiwan. The government of China have said that if the people of Taiwan formally votes to become the Republic of Taiwan, they will invade Taiwan. So, there is now a situation where both sides are not making any big changes. In March 2004, China's government passed a law that will allow China to invade Taiwan if the people of Taiwan vote to become the Republic of Taiwan. This law hurt the feelings of the people in Taiwan very much, especially since the government of mainland China does not rule Taiwan. It has caused even more people in Taiwan to not want to be re-united with mainland China.",
   "Creativity": "Creativity (or creativeness) is the ability of a person to be creative, take part in creating, or be useful in a creative network of other people. It is very difficult to measure, and some think it should not be measured. The reason is that creativity can not be defined - although several attempts have been made, a shared definition of the concept of creativity still comes up short. Some think creativity is an important thing that makes humans different from apes. Others recognize that even apes, other primates, other mammals and some birds adapt to survive by being creative (for example - primates using tools). Liane Gabora believes that all culture comes from creativity, not imitation. Therefore, these people say, human science should focus on it: Ethics for example would focus on finding creative solutions to ethical dilemmas. Politics would focus on the political virtues that need some creativity. Imitation would not be the focus of education. Linguistics might be more interested in how new words are created by culture, rather than in how existing ones are used in grammar. Intellectual interests (recognized as intellectual rights or intellectual property in the law) are a way to reward creativity in law, but they do not always work very well. A good example is copyright which is supposed to pay authors and artists, but may only pay lawyers to make (imitative) arguments in court. Creativity is a central question in economics, where it is known as ingenuity (the ability to come up with new ideas) or individual capital - capacities that individuals have, that do not arise from simple imitation of what is known already. This is separate from the instructional capital that might try to capture some of that in a patent or training system that helps others do what the individual leader or founder of the system can do. In urban economics there are various ways to measure creativity - the Bohemian Index and Gay Index are two attempts to do this accurately and predict the economic growth of cities based on creativity.

   "Montreal": "Montreal (spelled \"Montr\u00e9al\" in French) is a city in the country of Canada. It is the largest city in the province of Quebec and the second-largest city overall in Canada. Montreal is built on an island sitting in the Saint Lawrence River. More than three million people live in and around the Montreal metropolitan area. At the center of Montreal lies a mountain called 'Mount Royal', which is almost entirely part of a large city park. Most of the people who live in Montreal speak French, but English is commonly spoken as well. History. The origin of the name 'Montr\u00e9al' is derived from \"Mons realis\", which means 'Mount Royal' in latin. Montreal has always played a very important part in the history and development of Canada, and continues to be a large Canadian industrial and commercial center, as well as a major sea port (via the Saint Lawrence River). It once was the largest city in Canada, before Toronto grew to be larger. Montreal is a very historical and culturally interesting place for visitors. One can visit the Old City in horse drawn carriages, where many buildings from the earliest years are standing proud, all of which is a constant reminder (and source of inspiration) to describe a lot about the way of life that started in the New World, when Montreal was just a fur trading outpost belonging to France over 350 years ago. Economy. Many large corporations have their main offices in Montreal. The city is home to four major Universities, harbouring students from all parts of Canada and from all over the world. Culture. Montreal features many beautiful churches (Montreal is referred to locally as 'the city of a hundred churches'), including the largest church in Canada, and also many important art, history, and science museums. You can also visit the location of the 1967 World's Fair, where today, as well as many other attractions, one will find the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve Formula One automobile race course. Also of interest is the site where the 1976 Summer Olympic Games were held, and the modern architecture of the Olympic stadium (the 'Big O') and its tall inclined observation tower (the highest inclined tower in the world); now a landmark of Montreal. A lot of Montrealers are interested in hockey, with Montreal's professional hockey team, the, being one of the most famous in the world. To many people, Montreal is both beautiful to live in and to visit, day and night.",
   "Contact network": "A contact network is a group of people who can all quickly get in touch with each other. It does not guarantee any kind of help or access to knowledge other than that. A creative network, social network and power network are also contact networks. These include some kind of guarantee or expectation of help. Thus they involve more investment per person.",
   "Alaska": "The State of Alaska is one of the states of the United States, although it is connected to Canada. It was purchased from Imperial Russia in 1867 for $7.2 million. Geography. The capital city is Juneau, but the biggest city is Anchorage. Alaska is the biggest state in the United States, but has the least people. It is not connected to any other states by American land, but it is connected to Canada. Alaska has many glaciers, some of which are passed by or landed on by cruises or National Parks. Some are coastal, some landlocked. It is an extremely popular tourist destination, as there is a very rich culture along with beautiful scenery. There are some important industries in Alaska, like fishing, mining, and forestry. There were many gold rushes in Alaska.",
   "German": "It can mean the German language. It can mean a person from the country the Federal Republic of Germany, or one of the earlier countries in the same area. When talking about a person, it can mean someone who lives in Germany, or someone who thinks of himself or herself as 'German'.",
   "Cup": "Some are expensive, maybe old, mostly painted by hand; a few people collect such cups, and do not use them. A cup is also a unit of liquid measurement in some countries. A cup can also be an award.",

   "Telescope": "A telescope is an important tool for astronomy. The telescope gathers and focuses light. Telescopes make things seem bigger and brighter. Galileo was the first person to use a telescope for astronomy, but he did not invent them. Telescopes not used for astronomy can be named \"transits\", \"spotting scopes\", \"monoculars\", \"binoculars,\" \"camera lenses\", or \"spyglasses\". The word \"telescope\" is usually used for light your eyes can see, but there are telescopes for \"invisible\" light. Infrared telescopes look like normal telescopes, but have to be kept cold since infrared light is heat. Radio telescopes are like radio antennas, usually shaped like large dishes. X-ray and gamma-ray telescopes have a problem because the rays go through most metals and glasses. To solve this problem, they are shaped like a bunch of rings inside each other. The first telescope was invented in the Netherlands in 1608.",
   "Democracy": "A democracy (a word from the Greek language, meaning \"rule by the people\") is a form of government. In a democracy, certain people of a community choose their leaders. There are different ways to do this, but the process is usually called \"holding an election\". Political parties are involved with politics. It may therefore look easy to pick a political party. The party that gets elected will then choose people to lead. Very often those leaders will also decide the laws. In a democracy, there are elections every few years where the people can vote and choose who they want to lead them, or choose the laws. The decision is made based on the number of votes. The side with the most votes wins. Examples of democracies are India, Mexico, and the United States. Kinds of Democracy. There are two kinds of democracy: Direct and Indirect (also known as Representative democracy). In Direct Democracies, everyone has the right to make laws together. One modern example of direct democracy is a referendum, which is the name for the kind of way to pass a law where everyone in the community votes on it. Direct democracies are not used to run countries, because it is hard to get millions of people to get together all the time to make laws and other decisions. In an Indirect, or Representative Democracy, people choose representatives to make laws for them. These people can be mayors, councilmen, Members of Parliament, or other government officials. This is a much more common kind of democracy. Large communities like cities and countries use this method, but it may not be needed for a small group. History. This kind of government was developed long ago by the ancient Greeks in the city of Athens (potatoes rock your socks.) They had everyone who was a Citizen (Slaves, Women, Foreigners, and Children could not vote) get together in one area. The Assembly would talk about what kinds of laws they wanted and voted on them. The Council would suggest the laws. In the Assembly, the participants are only the citizens. In the Council, they would pick them by draws(lot). The participants in the Council would change every year and the amount of people in the Council is maximum 500. The Greek citizens would pick a leader by writing the name of their favorite candidate on a piece of stone or wood. The candidate with the most votes became the leader.",
   "France": "France (French: \"France\"), officially the French Republic (French: \"R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise\") is a country in Europe. Its capital city is Paris. France is a member of the European Union. France is known for its many monuments, structures, and places such as the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, Giverny, Versailles, and Notre Dame. France is a country divided into \"r\u00e9gions\" and \"d\u00e9partements\". France has been one of the world's biggest powers since the end of the 17th century. In the 18th and 19th centuries, France built a very big colonial empire. It is across West Africa and Southeast Asia. France is the most visited country in the world. 82 million foreign tourists visit it every year. France is a founding member of the European Union. It has the largest land area any of the members. France is also a founding member of the United Nations, and a member of the G8 and NATO. It is one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. France is a nuclear power with active warheads and nuclear power plants. There are many cities in France. Some of them are Nice, Marseille, Bordeaux, Lille, Lyon, Toulouse, Strasbourg, Nantes and of course Paris. Geography. France is in Western Europe. France has borders with Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Monaco, Andorra, and Spain. France has two mountain ranges near its borders: the Alps and the Pyrenees. In France there are a lot of rivers. Two of these rivers are the Seine and the Loire. In the north and west of France there are low hills and river valleys. In France there are many different climates. The Atlantic has a large effect on the weather in the north and west. This means the temperature is about the same most of the year. In the east winters are cold and clear. Summers are hot and stormy. In the south, summers are hot and dry. Winters are cool and wet. History. The name \"France\" comes from Latin \"Francia\", which literally means \"land of the Franks\" or \"Frankland\". The borders of modern France are about the same as those of ancient Gaul. Ancient Gaul was inhabited by Celtic \"Gauls\". Gaul was conquered for Rome by Julius Caesar in the 1st century BC. Eventually, the Gauls adopted Roman speech (Latin, from which the French language evolved) and Roman culture. Christianity first appeared in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. It became firmly established by the fourth and fifth centuries. In the 4th century AD, the Germanic tribes, principally the Franks invaded the gauls. This is how the name \"Francie\" appeared. The modern name \u201cFrance\u201d comes from the name of the Capetian Kings of France around Paris. The Franks were the first tribe of Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to Catholic Christianity rather than Arianism. The French called themselves \u201cthe Most Christian Kingdom of France\u201d. The Treaty of Verdun (843), divided Charlemagne's Empire into three parts. The biggest area was Western Francia. It was the precursor to modern France. The \"Carolingian\" dynasty ruled France until 987, when Hugh Capet became King of France. His descendants, the Direct Capetians, the House of Valois and the House of Bourbon, unified the country with many wars and dynastic inheritance. The monarchy was the most powerful during the 17th century and the reign of Louis XIV of France. At that time France had the largest population in Europe (see Demographics of France). The country had a big influence over European politics, economy, and culture. French became the common language of diplomacy in international affairs. Much of the Enlightenment happened in France. Major scientific breakthroughs were achieved by French scientists in the 18th century. France also obtained many overseas possessions in the Americas, Africa and Asia. France had a monarchy until the French Revolution in 1789. King Louis XVI and his wife, Marie Antoinette, were executed in 1793. Thousands of other French citizens were also killed. Napoleon Bonaparte took control of the Republic in 1799. He later made himself Emperor of the First Empire (1804\u20131814). His armies conquered most of continental Europe. After Napoleon's final defeat in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo, the French monarchy was re-established. Later Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte created the Second Empire in 1852. Louis-Napol\u00e9on was removed after the defeat in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870. His regime was replaced by the Third Republic. France built a large colonial empire in the 18th and 19th centuries. The empire included parts of West Africa and Southeast Asia. The culture and politics of these regions were influenced by France. Many ex-colonies officially speak the French language. Administrative divisions. Then France is divided into 100 departments. The departments are divided into 342 arrondissements. The \"arrondissements\" are re-divided into 4,032 cantons. The smallest subdivision is the commune. On January 1, 2008, INSEE counted 36,781 communes in France. 36,569 of them are in metropolitan France and 212 of them are in overseas France. This is more than in any other European country. Government. The government of France is a semi-presidential system determined by the French Constitution of the French fifth Republic. The nation declares itself to be \"an indivisible, secular, democratic, and social Republic\" in it. The constitution provides for a separation of powers. It proclaims France's \"attachment to the Rights of Man defined by the Declaration of 1789.\" Military. There are about 359,000 military personnel in France. France spends 2.6% of its GDP on defence. This is the highest in the European Union. France and the UK spend 40% of the EU defence budget. About 10% of France's defence budget is for nuclear weapons force. Foreign relations. France is a member of the United Nations. It is permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and has veto rights. It is also a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). It hosts the headquarters of the OECD, UNESCO and Interpol. In 1953, France was asked by the United Nations to choose a coat of arms to represent them internationally. The French emblem is now on their passports. France was a founding member of the European Union. In the 1960s, France wanted to exclude the British from the organisation. It wanted to build its own power in continental Europe. Since the 1990s, France has got closer to Germany. This was to try to become the most influential country in the EU. It consequently created rivalry the UK and limited the influence of newly inducted East European nations. France is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. However, under President de Gaulle, it excluded itself from the joint military command. In the early 1990s, France was criticised for its underground nuclear tests in French Polynesia. France vigorously opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq. France retains strong political and economic influence in its former African colonies. For instance it has supplied economic aid and troops for peace-keeping missions in the Ivory Coast and Chad. Economy. France is a member of the G8 group of leading industrialised countries. France is ranked as the eighth largest economy in the world by Gross domestic product (GDP) adjusted for purchasing power parity which takes into account how much it costs to live in different countries and inflation rates. France and 11 other European Union members joined to launch the euro on 1 January 1999. France's economy has nearly 2.9 million companies registered. The government has a considerable influence over railway, electricity, aircraft, and telecommunications firms. France has an important aerospace (design of aircrafts and spacecrafts) industry led by Airbus. It can also launch space shuttles from French Guiana. France invested a lot in nuclear power. This made France the smallest producer of carbon dioxide among the seven most industrialized countries in the world. As a result, most of the electricity produced in the country is generated by 59 nuclear power plants (78% in 2006, up from only 8% in 1973, 24% in 1980, and 75% in 1990). France is the leading agricultural producer and exporter in Europe. France exports: Wheat, poultry, dairy products, beef and pork. It is also famous for its wine industry. France received $10 billion euros in 2006 from the European Community as subsidies to its farmers. Language. French is the official language of France. It belongs to the Romance language group, which includes Italian and Spanish. Many regional dialects are used in France. Alsatian, a German dialect is spoken in Alsace and in parts of Lorraine in eastern France. French used to be the language of diplomacy and culture in Europe around 17th - 19th century. Some people in France also speak Basque, Breton, Catalan, Corsican, German, Flemish, and Occitan. Religion. France is a secular country and freedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitution. The population is about 51% Roman Catholic and 31% is agnostics or atheists. 4% is identified as Muslim, 3% identified as Protestant and 1% identified as Jewish. 10% is identified as being from other religions or being without opinion. Literature. French literature began in the Middle Ages. French was divided into several dialects at the time. Each writer used his own spelling and grammar. During the 17th century Pierre Corneille, Jean Racine and Moli\u00e8re's plays and Blaise Pascal and Ren\u00e9 Descartes's books influenced the aristocracy. They also influenced future authors. In the 18th and 19th centuries, French literature and poetry reach its highest point. The 18th century saw the writings of such writers, essayists and moralists as Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. As for French children's literature in those times, Charles Perrault was probably the most famous writer. He wrote stories such as: \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood\u201d, \u201cCinderella\u201d, \u201cSleeping Beauty\u201d and \u201cPuss in Boots\u201d. Many famous French novels were written in the the 19th century by author such as Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas and Jules Verne. They wrote popular novels like The Three Musketeers, The Count of Monte-Cristo, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, or The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. Other 19th century fiction writers include Emile Zola, Guy de Maupassant, Th\u00e9ophile Gautier and Stendhal. Sports. The Tour de France cycling race in July is one of the best-known sporting events. It is a 3 week (3,500 km) race that covers most of France and ends in the center of Paris. Football is another popular sport in France. The French team won the FIFA World Cup in 1998 and the UEFA European Football Championship in 1984 and 2000. France is also famous for its \"24 Hours of Le Mans\" car race. France also hosted the Rugby World Cup in 2007 and finished fourth. France is closely associated with the Modern Olympic Games. At the end of the 19th century the Baron Pierre de Coubertin suggested to have Olympic Games again. France hosted the Summer Olympics twice. In 1900 and in 1924 in Paris. France also hosted the Winter Games three times. In 1924 in Chamonix, in 1968 in Grenoble and in 1992 in Albertville). Tourism. France is the first tourist destination in the world. In 2007, 81.9 million foreign tourists visited France. Spain comes second (58.5 million in 2006) and the United States come third (51.1 million in 2006). Some of the most famous attractions in France are the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe. They are in Paris, the capital of France. Another one is Mont Saint Michel. A European Disneyland is located in a suburb east of Paris. The resort opened in 1992 and is a popular tourist destination in Europe.",
   "Bubonic plague": "The Bubonic plague is a very deadly disease. Some of the symptoms of this disease are coughing, fever, and black spots on the skin. People think that the Black Death that killed millions of Europeans in the Middle Ages was bubonic plague, but they are not sure. Different kinds of the same disease. There are different kinds of Bubonic plague. The most common form of the disease is spread by a certain kind of flea, that lives on rats. Then there is an incubation period which can last from a few hours to about seven days. Sepsis. A Sepsis happens when the bacterium enters the bloodstream. Pneumonic plague. This happens when the bacterium can enter the lungs. About 95% of all people with this form will die. Incubation period is only one to two days. The abortive form. This is the most harmless form. It will result in a little fever. After that, there are antibodies that protect against all forms for a long time. History. During the 1300s, this epidemic struck parts of Asia, North Africa, and Europe. Almost a third of the people in Europe died of it. Unlike catastrophes that pull communities together, this epidemic was so terrifying that it broke people's trust in one another. Giovanni Boccaccio, an Italian writer of the time, described it: \"This scourge had implanted so great a terror in the hearts of men and women that brothers abandoned brothers, uncles their nephews, sisters their brothers, and in many cases wives deserted their husbands. But even worse... fathers and mothers refused to nurse and assist their own children.\" Transmission. The plague was not just carried by rats as some people assume. The fleas also carried it. It came abroad from Kaffa by the Black Sea. From there the disease started to go new places in 1347. It went to England in 1349. There it killed half of the people in England. 70% of people who got plague died. Pigs are also to blame for the transmission, as the bacteria stayed in their blood system, and when eaten, people caught the plague. This is a reason why so few Jews caught the disease. Modern history. In the 20th century, some countries did research on the bacteria that causes bubonic plague. They did research to use it for biological warfare. Samples of this bacteria are carefully controlled. There is much paranoia (fear) about it. Dr. Thomas C. Butler, a US expert in this organism was charged in October 2003 by the FBI with various crimes. This happened after he said he lost samples of \"Yersinia pestis\". This is the bacteria that causes bubonic plague. The FBI did not find the samples. They do not know what happened to them.",
   "London Borough of Camden": "The London Borough of Camden is a London Borough. It is in north London.",
   "Carnivore": "A carnivore is an animal that eats mostly meat. Dogs and cats are carnivores. The word \"Carnivora\" comes from Latin, where \"Carne\" means \"flesh\" or \"meat\", and \"Vorare\" is a verb meaning \"eat\", that is \"meat-eater\". \"Scavengers\" are carnivores that eat other animals which they did not kill themselves and which have been dead for a time. Carnivores that eat mainly or only insects are called \"insectivores\". Carnivores that eat mainly or only fish are called \"piscivores\". The word \"Carnivore\" also can mean any animal in the scientific order Carnivora. Most animals in Carnivora eat meat, but some do not.",
   "August": "August is the eighth month of the year. It has 31 days. This month was first called \"Sextilis\" in Latin, because it was the sixth month in the old Roman calendar. The Roman calendar began in March about 735 BC with Romulus. It was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King Numa Pompilius about 700 BC. Or, when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the decemvirs about 450 BC (Roman writers disagree). August is named for Augustus Caesar. The month has 31 days because the Roman senate wanted as many days as Julius Caesar's month July. Augustus is in summer, after July and before September. An extra month was moved from February in order to make the of August seem more important. This was undone when the leap year adjustment was made. August's flower is the Gladioli with the birthstone being Peridot.",
   "Web server": "A web server is a computer with a boot device or other disk containing a web site. The term may also refer to an application that helps a computer to perform web server functions. If one site runs more than one server they must use different port numbers. Alternatively, several hostnames may be mapped to the same computer in which case they are known as Apache and NCSA HTTPd are two popular web servers. There are many others including some for practically every platform. Servers differ mostly in the \"server-side\" features they offer such as server-side includes, and in their authentication and access control mechanisms. All decent servers support CGI and most have some binary API Server Languages. To work with the server, they must be a web-based language instead of being a language which is used to make normal computer programs.",
   "Protoplasm": "Protoplasm is the living substance that make up a cell. In plant cells, it is surrounded by a cell wall. In animal cell, the whole cell is made of protoplasm, surrounded by a cell membrane. Protoplasm in living beings is made up of about 75-80 percent water.",
   "Month": "A month is an amount of time used with calendars. It is about one twelfth of a year. It is a little longer than a natural period of the moon 29.53 days. In some cultures, the idea for months came from moon phases. People have counted days based on moon phases for a very long time. Some calendars are still strongly based on the moon, or \"lunar calendars\". Others, called \"solar calendars\", ignore the moon, and depend entirely on the Sun \u2014 for example, the Gregorian calendar of 365 or 366 days (twelve months) used in much of the world today.",
   "Ion": "In chemistry, a molecule or atom that is electrically charged is called an ion. It is called this because it has a different amount of electrons than it usually has. The process adding or subtracting electrons is called ionization. Many ions are colourless. Elements in the main groups in the Periodic Table form colourless ions. Some ions are coloured. The transition metal usually form coloured ions. In physics, atomic nuclei that have been completely ionized are called \"charged particles\". These are ones in alpha radiation. Ionization happens by applying high energy to atoms. This is done using electrical voltage or by high-energy radiation. An ionized gas is called plasma. A simple ion is formed from a single atom. Polyatomic ions are formed from a group of atoms. Polyatomic ions usually consist of all non-metals atoms, but sometimes the polyatomic ion can have a metallic atom too. Positive ions are called cations'\". They are attracted to cathodes (negatively charged electrodes). (\"Cation\" is pronounced \"cat eye on\", not \"kay shun\".) All simple metal ions are cations. Negative ions are called anions. They are attracted to anodes (positively charged electrodes). All simple non-metal ions (except H+, which is a proton) are anions (except NH4+). Transition metals can form more than one simple cation with different charges. Most ions have a charge of less than 4, but some can have higher charges. Michael Faraday was the first person to write a theory about ions. He did this in 1830. In his theory, he said what the portions of molecules were like that moved to anions or cations. Svante August Arrhenius said how this happened. He wrote this in his doctoral dissertation in 1884. Arrhenius was studying at the University of Uppsala. The university did not accept his theory at first (he only just passed his degree). But in 1903, he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1903 for the same idea. In Greek \"ion\" is like the word \"go\". \"Anion\" and \"cation\" mean \"up-goer\" and \"down-goer\". \"Anode\" and \"cathode\" are \"way up\" and \"way down\". Other meanings. In Greek mythology, Ion was a son of Xuthus and Creusa. He founded the Ionian race and became a king of Athens. The term is also used for an element of the Plato texts, and a Window manager.",
   "Fine": "The word fine is used in English with two very different meanings. 1) People sometimes use the word fine as an adjective to mean that something is good. 2) We also use the word fine as a noun with a different meaning. Often, if a court or a judge says that someone did a crime, then the person has to pay some money to their government. This money is called a fine. Governments make these fines so people won't want to do the crime. Sometimes we often use the word \"fine\" in the same way for businesses instead of governments. For example there are some businesses that will let us take books or videos to use in our homes for a few days. But if we keep the book or video for too long, we might have to pay a fine to that business.",
   "Infinity": "Infinity, also written formula_1, is larger than any number that can possibly be imagined. The term is from a Latin word meaning \"without end\". Infinity is really not a number, but it is sometimes used as one. Numbers can be counted, but infinity cannot be counted. Now, people are proposing that infinity is just an abstract concept. Infinity can be broken up in two different kinds; potential and actual infinity. Potential infinity is a process that never stops. For example, adding 10 to a number. No matter how many times 10 is added, 10 more can still be added. Actual infinity is something that we cannot imagine or put a value on in our system of concepts.",
   "June": "June is the sixth month of the year; it has 30 days. June is named for the Roman goddess Juno, the wife of Jupiter, and she is goddess of marriage, so getting married in June was thought to be lucky. June begins on a different day of the week each year. June's flower is the Rose and the birthstone is the pearl. The meaning for the birthstone pearl is health.",
   "Jupiter": "Jupiter (pronounced is the largest planet in the Solar System. It is the fifth planet from the Sun. Jupiter is classed as a gas giant. This is because it is very big and made up of gas. Other gas giants include Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Jupiter has twice the mass of all the other planets in the Solar System put together. Jupiter has been known by astronomers for thousands of years. The ancient Romans named it for the Roman god Jupiter. At some times Jupiter can be the third brightest object in the night sky. Only the Moon and Venus are brighter. Jupiter has at least 63 moons. Most of these moons are very small at less than 5km wide. The four main moons are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. These four are called the Galilean moons. They are called this because they were discovered by the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System. It is bigger than the planet Mercury. Structure. Jupiter is one of the four gas giants. This is because it is made of gas. Other planets, for example Earth or Mars, are made of solid rock. It is the biggest planet in the Solar System with a diameter or width of 142,984 km. This is eleven times the diameter of Earth. What it is made of. The atmosphere, or air, near the surface of Jupiter is estimated to be 75% hydrogen and 24% helium with remaining 1% made up of other gases. Further into the planet it is so hot and the pressure so high that helium becomes a liquid and precipitates or rains further down into the planet. Based on spectroscopy, Jupiter seems to be made of similar gases to Saturn. It is not as similar to Neptune or Uranus. These two planets have much less hydrogen and helium gas. It is difficult to learn about the core of Jupiter. The very high temperatures and pressures mean scientists cannot tell what materials would be there. We cannot find out because we cannot create the same amount of pressure on Earth. Above the unknown inner core is an outer core. On Earth, this is liquid rock. The outer core of Jupiter is thick, liquid hydrogen. The pressure is enough to make the hydrogen solid, but then it melts because of the heat. Mass. Jupiter is twice as massive than all the other planets in the Solar System put together. Because of all the gas near the core, it gives off more heat than it gets from the sun. Jupiter is 11 times the size of Earth and 318 times as massive. The volume of Jupiter is 1,317 times the volume of Earth. In other words, 1317 Earth sized objects could fit inside it. Cloud Layers. Jupiter has many bands of clouds going horizontally across its surface. The light parts are called \"zones\" and the darker are called \"belts\". The zones and belts often interact with each other. This causes huge storms. Wind speeds of 360 kilometres an hour are common on Jupiter. To show the difference the strongest tropical storms on Earth are about 100 km/h. Most of the clouds on Jupiter are made of ammonia. There may also be clouds of water vapour similar to clouds on Earth. Scientists think this because spacecraft such as Voyager 1 have seen lightning on the surface of the planet and lightning needs water vapour. These lightning bolts have been measured as up 1,000 times as powerful as those on Earth. The brown and orange colours are caused when sunlight passes through or refracts with the many gases in the atmosphere. The Great Red Spot and other storms. One of the biggest features in Jupiter's atmosphere is the Great Red Spot. It is a huge storm which is bigger than the entire Earth. It has been known about for just under 200 years and possibly even longer. Storms such as these are common in the atmospheres of the gas giant planets. Storms can last for hours or as long as hundreds of years in the case of the Great Red Spot. Magnetic Field. Jupiter has a magnetic field similar to Earth's but much stronger. It is also known as a \"magnetosphere\". The strength of the field is enough to be a serious danger to any spacecraft travelling past or to Jupiter. The magnetic field is probably caused by the large amounts of liquid, metallic hydrogen in the core of Jupiter. The four largest moons of Jupiter orbit or go around the planet within the magnetic field. This protects them from the solar wind. Jupiter's magnetic field is so large, it reaches the orbit of Saturn 7.7 million miles away. In comparison Earth's magnetosphere does not even cover the Moon, less than a million miles away. Orbit. The orbit of a planet is the time and path it takes to go around the Sun. In the amount of time it takes for Jupiter to orbit the Sun one time, the Earth orbits the Sun 11.86 times. One year on Jupiter is equal to 11.86 years on Earth. The average distance between Jupiter and the Sun is 778 million kilometres. This is five times the distance between Earth and the Sun. Jupiter is not tilted on its axis as much as the Earth or Mars. This causes it to have no seasons, for example Summer or Winter. Jupiter rotates, or spins around, very fast. This causes the planet to bulge in the middle. Jupiter is the fastest spinning planet in the Solar System. It completes one rotation or spin in 10 hours. Because of the bulge, the length of the equator of Jupiter is much longer than the length from pole to pole. From Earth. Jupiter is the third brightest object in the night sky, after the Moon and Venus. Because of that, people have always been able to see it from Earth. The first person known to really study the planet was Galileo Galilei in 1610. He was the first person to see Jupiter's moons Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. This was because he used a telescope, unlike anyone before him. No new moons were discovered for more than two hundred years. In 1892 an astronomer called E.E Barnard found a new moon using his observatory in California. He called the moon Amalthea. It was the last of Jupiter's 63 moons to be discovered by human observation through a telescope. In 1994, bits of the comet Shoemaker Levy-9 hit Jupiter. Thousands of astronomers on Earth watched this happen. It was the first time a collision or crash between two Solar System objects had been directly seen by people. From spacecraft. Eight spacecraft have either flown past or visited Jupiter since 1973. These were Pioneer 10 (1973), Pioneer 11 (1974), Voyagers 1 and 2 (1979), Ulysses (1992 and 2004), Cassini (2000) and New Horizons in 2007. The Pioneer missions were the first spacecraft to take close up pictures of Jupiter and its moons. Five years later, the two Voyager spacecraft discovered over 20 new moons. They captured photo evidence of lightning on the night side of Jupiter. The Ulysses probe was sent to study the Sun. It only went to Jupiter after it had finished its main mission. Ulysses had no cameras so it took no photographs. In 2006 the Cassini spacecraft, on its way to Saturn, took some very good, very clear pictures of the planet. Cassini also found a moon and took a picture of it but it was too far away to show the details. The Galileo mission in 1995 is the only spacecraft to go into orbit or go around Jupiter. It flew around the planet for seven years and studied all of the four biggest moons. It launched a probe into the planet to get information about Jupiter's atmosphere. The probe travelled to a depth of about 150km before it was crushed by the weight of all the gas above it. This is called pressure. The Galileo spacecraft was also crushed in 2003 when NASA steered the craft into the planet on purpose. They did this so that the craft could not crash into Europa, a moon which scientists think might have life. Future. NASA is planning to send another spacecraft to Jupiter called \"Juno\". It will launch in 2011. The craft will go into orbit around the planet in 2016. Several missions have been planned to send spacecraft to Jupiter's moons Europa and Callisto. One called \"JIMO\" (Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter) was cancelled in 2006 because it cost too much money. Moons. Jupiter has over 63 known moons. Only 13 of these were first seen from Earth because the rest are too small. The smallest moon (2003 J 12) is only 1 kilometre across. The biggest, Ganymede, has a diameter of 5,262 kilometres. It is bigger than the planet Mercury. Along with Io, Europa and Callisto, Ganymede is one of the Galilean moons, the four biggest moons of Jupiter. Because of the way they orbit Jupiter, gravity affects three of these moons greatly. The friction caused by the gravity of Europa and Ganymede pulling on Io makes it the most volcanic object in the Solar System. It has over 400 volcanoes, more than three times as many as Earth. Jupiter in the Solar System. Jupiter's large gravity has had a big effect on the Solar System. Jupiter protects the inner planets from comets by pulling them towards itself. Because of this Jupiter has the most comet impacts in the Solar System. A group of asteroids called the \"Trojan asteroids\" follow Jupiter as it goes around the Sun. It is the only planet that has a group of asteroids similar to this.",
   "Argentina": "Argentina or the Rep\u00fablica Argentina, is a country in south South America. Argentina is the second-largest country in South America and the eighth-largest country in the world. About 39 million people live in the Argentina. Spanish is the language most people speak and the official language, but many other languages are spoken. Some of these are Guarani, Mapudungun and Quechua and even Welsh in Patagonia. The capital city of the Argentina is Buenos Aires, one of the largest cities in the world, in eastern Argentina. In order by number of people, the largest cities in Argentina are Buenos Aires, C\u00f3rdoba, Rosario, Mendoza, La Plata, Tucum\u00e1n, Mar del Plata, Salta, Santa Fe, and Bah\u00eda Blanca. Argentina is located between the Andes mountain range in the west and the southern Atlantic Ocean in the east and south. It is bordered by Paraguay and Bolivia in the north, Brazil and Uruguay in the northeast, and Chile in the west and south. It also claims the the Falkland Islands (Spanish: \"Islas Malvinas\") and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. History. The name Argentina comes from the Latin \"argentum\" (silver) as the Spanish conquistadors believed the area had silver. In the Americas, Canada, US, Brazil and Argentina are the largest countries (in that order). The oldest signs of people in Argentina are located in the Patagonia (Piedra Museo, Santa Cruz), and are more than 13,000 years old. In 1480 the Inca Empire conquered northwestern Argentina, making it part of the empire. In the northeastern area, the Guaran\u00ed developed a culture based on yuca and sweet potato however typical dishes all around Argentina are pasta, red wines (Italian influence) and beef. Other languages spoken are Italian, English and German. Lunfardo is Argentinean slang and is a mix of Spanish and Italian. Argentineans are said to speak Spanish with an Italian accent. Politics. Argentina is a federal republic. The people of Argentina vote for a President to rule them and Senators and Deputies to speak for them and make laws for them. The President is Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner since December 2007. Geography. Argentina is almost 3,700 km long from north to south, and 1,400 km from east to west (maximum values). It can be divided into three parts: the Pampas in the central part of the country, Patagonia in the southern part down to Tierra del Fuego; and the Andes mountain range along the western border with Chile, with the highest point located in the province of Mendoza. Cerro Aconcagua, at 6,960 metres (22,834 ft), is the Americas' highest mountain. The most important rivers include the River Plate, Paraguay, Bermejo, Colorado, Uruguay and the largest river, the Paran\u00e1. River Plate was incorrectly translated though, and should have been translated to English as River of (the) Silver. River Plate is also a famous Buenos Aires soccer team. Other information. The majority of the Argentineans are descendants of Europeans mainly from Spain, Italy, Germany, Ireland, France, other Europeans countries and Mestizo representing more than 90% of the total population of the country. Football or soccer is the most popular sport, although the national sport of the country is Pato. Argentina has a number of highly-ranked Polo players. Field hockey (for women) rugby and golf are also favorites. Argentina is a Christian country. Most of Argentina's people (80 percent) are Roman Catholic. Roman Catholicism is the state religion but Argentina also has the largest population of Jewish community after Israel and US. Many Middle Eastern immigrants who were Muslims converted to Catholicism, but there are still Muslims as well. Medicine is socialized and so is education, making Argentina's literacy rate about 98%. State University is free as well.",
   "Theology": "Theology is the study of one or more religions. Theology may be studied for many reasons. Some study theology to better understand their own religion, while others study theology so that they can compare religions. The word \u2018theology\u2019 was first used to describe the study of the Christian God, but some now use it to describe the study of religion generally, but not everyone agrees that it is right to do so. Some people use the words 'comparative theology' when they want to mean discussing the theology of more than one religion at once.",
   "Elephant": "Elephants are the largest living land mammals. The largest elephant known was a male shot in Angola in 1974. It weighed 12 tonnes (13.5 tons). An elephant child is called a \"calf\". At birth, a calf can have a weight of 100 kg (225 pounds). The baby elephant develops for 20 to 22 months inside its mother. No other land animal takes this long to develop before being born. An elephant's most obvious part is the \"trunk\". The trunk is a very long nose, made from the upper lip. An elephant uses its trunk to grab objects such as food. Elephants also have \"tusks\". Tusks are large teeth coming out of their upper jaws. A lot of ivory comes from elephant tusks. Ivory traders killed too many elephants, so now hunting them is illegal. The number of elephants has tripled in the last 6 months. People knew for a long time there were different kinds of elephants. The scientific word for a kind of animal is \"species\". These species are African and Asian elephants. African elephants are larger and have bigger ears. These big ears have many \"veins\", which carry blood throughout the body. Scientists think that the blood going through their ears helps African elephants to cool off. The weather is hotter in Africa than in Asia, so it is hard for elephants to stay cool. Female African elephants have tusks, but female Asian elephants do not. African elephants have a low place in their back. African elephants have two \"fingers\" at the end of their trunks, but Asian elephants only have one. Elephants eat a lot of grass. Grass is hard to chew, so their teeth are very important. Elephants have 24 teeth: 12 front teeth, called \"premolars\", and 12 back teeth, called \"molars\". The teeth come out in order, from front to back. Because grass is very tough, the elephant teeth slowly wear out. When the last molar wears out, the elephant usually dies because it cannot eat. But in a zoo or circus, people can keep elephants alive by feeding them soft food. Scientists call the elephant genus (group of related animals) \"Loxodonta\" because \"loxodont\" means a kind of molar. Some African elephants live on the savanna while others live in the forest. Today, many people think these are different species. Scientists named the forest group \"Loxodonta cyclotis\" and the savanna group \"Loxodonta africanus\". This means that African elephants are even more in danger of dying off forever than people used to think. Humans have used elephants for different things. The Carthaginian general Hannibal took some elephants across the Alps when he fought the Romans. He probably used the North African elephant, a kind of elephant that does not live today. It was smaller than other African elephants. People have used elephants to move around and to have fun. Many circuses have them. Siamese, Indians, and other South Asians used them for several things. They fought in armies, and they crushed criminals. They also did heavy work like lifting trees and moving logs. However, people have never \"domesticated\" elephants. Domesticated animals are tame and have babies under human control. The male elephant in heat is dangerous and hard to control. Most elephants used by people are female, except those used in war. In a battle, female elephants run from males, so armies needed males. In the wild, elephants have strong family groups. Their ways of acting toward other elephants are hard for people to understand. They \"talk\" to each other with very low sounds. Most elephants sounds are so low, people cannot hear them. But elephants can hear these sounds far away. Elephants are related to sea cows, which are large mammals that live in water. Some people think that long ago, the ancestors of elephants also lived under water. Evolution is how one species changes into another. The ancestors of elephants would have used their trunks for breathing air while they swam. Even today, elephants can swim like this. The extinct animals called mammoths were relatives of today's elephants. Modern elephants live only in warm places, but the woolly mammoth had long hair and lived in cold places. Miscellaneous. White elephants are considered holy in Thailand. The most famous fictional elephant is Dumbo. It is a flying elephant in a Disney movie. \"The Elephant's Child\" is one of Rudyard Kipling's \"Just So Stories\" Ganesha is the god of wisdom in Hinduism. He has an elephant's head. The elephant is the symbol for the United States Republican Party. It is like the Democratic Party's donkey. The first person to use the elephant as a symbol for the Republican Party was Thomas Nast. He did that in a Harper's Weekly cartoon in 1874. Elephants also have very large brains and are very smart.",
   "Cavity": "A cavity is a hole.",
   "Atom": "An atom is the most simple type of particle that makes up matter. Matter is anything that has mass and uses space. It is the smallest part of an element that still has the properties of that certain element. When you see atoms as ball-shaped, they have diameters of about 10-10 meters (that's 0.0000000001 m). They have masses around 10-23g (that's 0.00000000000000000000001 g.) Origin. The word \"atom\" comes from the Greek \u1f00\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, \"indivisible\", from \u1f00-, \"not,\" and \u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, \"a cut.\" Until the end of the 19th century, many people believed atoms were very tiny, solid balls which could never be divided. This idea comes from Democritus and Leucippus, Greek philosophers in the 5th century BC. People believed this until the early 20th century when tests by physicists trying to provide nuclear power disproved it. Types of atom. Atoms are made of 3 kinds of sub-atomic particles - protons, neutrons and electrons. A proton has a positive charge. A neutron has no charge. An electron has a negative charge. Electrons have much less weight than the protons and neutrons. Electrons move very fast around the nucleus. In a neutral atom, the number of protons is the same as the number of electrons. In other atoms, such as [b]isotopes[/b] the number of neutrons is not the same as the number of protons. Charged atoms are called ions. Atoms with fewer electrons than protons have a positive charge. These atoms are called cations. Atoms with more electrons than protons have a negative charge. These atoms are called anions. Structure. The nucleus is at the center of an atom. The \"nucleus\" contains \"protons\" and \"neutrons\", which are tightly packed together. Because of this, the nucleus is positively charged. Protons and neutrons have similar mass. A nucleus is much smaller than its atom. The nucleus is more than 100,000 times smaller than the atom - the size of the atom is determined by the size of the outer electron shell. For an example of size difference, if the atom were the size of a football stadium, the atom's nucleus would be the size of a pea in the middle. Most of an atom is empty space which is occupied by electrons spinning around. Shells. Electrons orbit at different distances from the nucleus. We say those closest to the nucleus are in one \"shell,\" and those a little farther away are in another \"shell.\" Each shell is given a number. The one closest to the nucleus is shell 1, the next one out is shell 2, and so on. Classification. Atoms are usually put into groups based on their atomic number. The atomic number of an atom is the number of protons in the atom. The atomic number decides what family or \"element\" the atom belongs to. For example, carbon atoms are atoms with 6 protons in their nucleus. All atoms with the same atomic number share many of physical properties and have the same chemical behavior. The different kinds of atoms are listed in the Periodic table. The mass number or \"nucleon number\" is the total of protons and neutrons. The number of neutrons does not change the element of the atom - within an element family are several members, each with the same atomic number but different mass numbers. These are called isotopes. To write the name of an isotope, we write the name of an element, then its mass number. For example, Carbon-14 (which has 6 protons and 8 neutrons in each atom). Some isotopes are radioactive, meaning they give off radiation. Others are called stable, meaning they do not give off any radiation. Any atom that has an atomic number of 83 or higher is also radioactive, whatever isotope it is. Radioactive atoms and isotopes are dangerous to any living thing except in very small amounts. They should only be handled by experts because they can make people very sick if not handled correctly. Doctors sometimes use isotopes. For example, the isotopes of Barium and Iodine are used to help find illnesses, but they should still be handled very carefully, even though they use very small amounts which are not enough to make a person sick. Only 94 different types of atoms are found in nature, A few more have been made in laboratories). The next element we make could be an ultra-light solid. It could be a liquid with a boiling point of over 2,000,000 degrees Celsius. The Periodic Table. Every different kind of atom has a name and every name has an abbreviation. The 94 kinds of atoms are usually listed in a table. The table is called the periodic table. A scientist called Dmitri Mendeleev was the first to think of the table. Because of this and other things he did, element 101 was called Mendelevium when it was discovered. Lots of atoms that have higher numbers are radioactive, like radium and uranium, and should never be handled without a lot of care and protection because they give off so much radiation. The simplest atom is the hydrogen atom, which has atomic number 1. The most common type of hydrogen atom has 1 proton and 1 electron (with no neutron). The hydrogen isotope containing 1 additional neutron is called \"deuterium\"; the hydrogen isotope with 2 additional neutrons is called \"tritium\". It has been the subject of much interest in science, particularly in the early development of quantum theory. Examples. The first 11 kinds of atoms (also called elements) are called hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, neon and sodium. Their abbreviations are H, He, Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Ne, Na. You may notice that Sodium does not fit with Na. This is because sodium was most commonly called \"natrium\" in the past. This has carried over into other parts of science as well. \"Hyponatremia\" is an illness where the body lacks enough salt to function properly. The purpose of an atom. All matter and all substances are made up of these 95 kinds of atoms. Most things contain far fewer types of atoms. Water, for example, contains only atoms of hydrogen and oxygen. In water these atoms form combinations called molecules.",

   "Uranus": "Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun in the Solar System. It is a gas giant. It is the third largest planet in the solar system. The planet is made of ice, gases and liquid metal. Its atmosphere contains hydrogen, helium and Methane. The temperature on Uranus is \u2212197 degrees C (79\u00a0K). The planet is tilted on its axis so much that it is sideways. Uranus completes its turn around the Sun in 84 earth years. It completes its turn around itself in 17 hours and 14 minutes. This means there are 42,000 days in 1 uranian year. The distance between Uranus and Neptune is 1.6 billion km. Uranus was discovered in 1781. Uranus has 11 rings which are hard to see from earth. This planet can be seen with the naked eye under the perfect conditions. Some evidence suggests that this planet was catalogued as a star (34 Tauri) before its confirmed discovery. Uranus is named by Greek god Uranus, who was a god of sky. Moons. Uranus has 27 known natural satellites. The names for these satellites are chosen from characters from the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. The five main moons are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon. Exploring. In 1986, NASA's \"Voyager 2\" visited Uranus. The visit is the only attempt to investigate the planet from a short distance.",

   "Linear algebra": "Linear algebra describes ways to solve and manipulate (rearrange) systems of linear equations. These two equations form a system of linear equations. It is linear because none of the variables are raised to a power. Often the graph of a linear equation is a straight line. since it makes all of the original equations valid, that is, the value on left side of the equals sign is exactly the same as the value on the right side for both equations. Linear algebra uses a system of notation for describing system behavior, called a matrix. For the previous example, the coefficients of the equations can be stored in a coefficient matrix.",
   "Los Angeles, California": "Los Angeles (also called L.A.) is a city in southern California, in the United States of America. It has 3,847,400 people living in the city, and over 18 million people in the L.A. region. The city has an area of 1200 square kilometres. L.A. has the second largest population of any city in the USA, the first being New York City. It is the largest city in California. History. The name Los Angeles comes from the Spanish language and it means \"the Angels\". The name is an abbreviation from the original name of the place. The original name is \"El Pueblo de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora la Reina de los \u00c1ngeles de Porciuncula\" (in English, \"town of our lady the Queen of Angels of the little Portion\"). Los Angeles was founded in 1781. The area had earlier been explored by two Franciscan priests named Junipero Serra and Juan Crespi, when California still belonged to Spain. On April 4, 1850 California became a State of the USA. Geography. Los Angeles is a very large city, and the edges of the city are very far from the center, going from the beaches to the mountains. The Santa Monica Mountains run through the city, separating it into the San Fernando Valley to the north and the Los Angeles Basin to the south. Climate. The climate in Los Angeles is a Mediterranean climate. The weather is usually warm and dry during the summer, and it is cool and rainy in the winter. The weather is different depending on how far away from the ocean you are, so places near the beach usually do not get as hot in the summer. It is very rare for temperatures to go below freezing. The city receives about 15 inches (385 mm) of rain each year, although the amount can change a lot from year to year. Sights. L.A. has many famous sights. There are many very long beaches, such as Venice Beach. Many visitors go to Hollywood, home to the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the Mann's (Grauman's) Chinese Theater, a large cinema. Los Angeles also has many fine museums such as the L.A. County Museum of Art and the Getty Museum. Industries. Los Angeles is known for its large movie and television industry. Much of this is located in Hollywood. Some military aircraft are also made there. The music industry is also concentrated in the area. The city is also a banking center. Politics. The current mayor of Los Angeles is Antonio Villaraigosa.",
   "Political problems of China": "The People's Republic of China claims that the island of Taiwan is part of its territory, but the Republic of China (which was the government that controlled all of China from 1911 to 1949) still controls it.

The Macintosh was the first popular computer where people could click things on a screen. The newest version of Mac OS is called Mac OS X. It is based on Unix. New Macintosh computers can have Linux, Unix, Windows, or BeOS on them.",
   "Boot device": "A boot device makes a computer work. It is named after a boot which fits on the foot. The word bootstrap is also closely related, and means, to use something simpler to get something more complex to make itself work better. Devices that can boot a computer are usually boot disks or boot drives (normally a hard drive, but can be a floppy disk or a CD). Some network computers use \"boot chips\" that get the operating system over a network. Web phones also use such chips to identify the user to the cell network. Boot card standards may let many users boot kiosk computers with full privacy and access to all applications they own. There are also boot boards or boot \"add-in\" cards that are more permanent than boot cards. Some people refer to the boot device as just a boot and non-boot devices as data devices, although it is not the computer but the operating system that cares about the difference between these. Origin. The boot in boot device is the same as booting (or starting up). This is short for bootstrapping, or to start with simple stuff and make complex stuff out of it.",
   "Breakfast sausage": "Breakfast sausage is a type of fresh pork sausage made from seasoned ground meat mixed with bread crumbs. Breakfast sausage has a blander flavor than many other types of sausage, such as Polish or Italian-style sausages. Using breakfast sausages. Breakfast sausages are not cured or smoked like other types of sausages, which means that they have to be cooked soon after they are purchased (unless they are frozen). Uncooked sausages should be stored in the refrigerator or the freezer. Individuals handling them should wash their hands in hot soapy water, because uncooked pork is unhealthy for humans. Pork sausages have to be heated until all of the meat inside is cooked. They are usually fried or grilled in a pan until they are browned and served at breakfast, often with cooked eggs, pancakes, and toasted bread. Breakfast sausages are also used in other dishes, such as \"toads in the hole\" a cooked egg dish. Types of breakfast sausages. Different types made from pork and beef mixtures as well as poultry can now be found. There are also vegetarian types that use textured vegetable protein in place of meat. Breakfast sausages are available in patties or slices from a large roll, or in weiner-like links of different lengths and thickness.",
   "Water": "Water is the most common liquid on Earth. It covers more than three-fourths of Earth's area. Pure water has no smell, taste, or color. Lakes, oceans, and rivers are made of water. Rain is water that falls from clouds in the sky. If water gets very cold, it freezes and becomes ice. Frozen rain can be ice or snow. If water gets very hot, it boils and becomes steam. Plants and animals (including people) must drink water to live. It gives a medium for chemical reactions to take place, and is the main part of blood. It keeps the body temperature unchanging by sweating from the skin. Water helps blood carry nutrients from the stomach to all parts of the body to keep the body alive. Water also helps the blood carry oxygen from the lungs to the body. Saliva helps animals and people digest food. Water helps make urine. Urine helps remove bad chemicals from the body. The human body is 60\u201370% water. Water is the main component of drinks like milk, juice, and wine. Each type of drink also has other things that add flavor or nutrients, things like sugar, fruit, and sometimes alcohol. Water that a person can drink is called \"potable\" (or \"drinking\") water. The water in oceans is salt water, but lakes and rivers usually have unsalted water. There is only about 3% fresh water on earth, the rest is salt water. Water is a molecule made of 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom. Its formula is H2O. Water has a surface tension. So a little water forms drops on a surface, rather than spreading out to wet the surface. Water can also be called aqua",
   "Phases of the Moon": "The phases of the moon are the different ways the moon looks during the month. As the Moon moves in space, different parts of it face the Sun. This means that different parts of it are lit up. We only see one side of the moon from Earth because it rotates so that one side is always facing us. The moon phase takes between 29 and 30 days.",

   "Jesus": "Jesus (born between 7 and 4 BC in Bethlehem, died in 30, 31, or 33 AD in Jerusalem) was the man whose life and teachings started the Christian religion. He was a Jew and came from a town called Nazareth in Galilee, in the country that is today called Israel. The name \"Jesus\" comes from the Aramaic name \"Yeshua\", from Hebrew \"Yehovah-shua\", meaning \"God saves\" which was a popular name of the time. Jesus is often called \"Jesus Christ\" or \"Christ\". The word \"Christ\" comes from the Greek word \"christos\" and means \"the one marked on the head with oil\" or \"the anointed one\". In Jesus' country, anointing was done to show that a person was chosen to be a king or a leader. Jesus is also called \"Messiah\", which comes from the Hebrew term \"Moshiach\", and also means \"the anointed one.\" Stories about the life of Jesus have been recorded by different writers. The best known are four books called the Gospels. They form the New Testament, a part of the Bible. Gospel means \"Good News.\" The \"Gospels\" were written by people who followed Jesus and believed in him. They tell a little about his birth, and mostly about his adult life: his teachings, ministry and death. There are four \"Gospels\", called \"the Gospel of Mark\", \"the Gospel of Matthew\", \"the Gospel of Luke\", and \"the Gospel of John\". Several Jewish and Roman historians such as Flavius Josephus, Tacitus, Pliny the Younger and Suetonius also mention Jesus in their writings. They usually only mention his execution or problems between the Roman Government and his followers; they do not talk about his life. Most Christians remember the day that Jesus was born as the holiday of Christmas. Although the Gospels do not say what day Jesus was born, Early Christians living in Rome chose 25th December because there was already a Roman holiday on that day. They also celebrate the time that the Gospels say he died and was raised from the dead as the holiday of Easter. Jesus in the Bible. This section is about the birth, ministry and death of Jesus. It is taken from the four books of the Bible, called the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. They were written in the 1st century AD. Nearly all other writing about Jesus is based on these four books. Jesus' birth. The Gospels of Matthew and Luke say that before the birth of Jesus, both Mary his mother, and the man that she was promised to, Joseph, knew that Jesus was going to be the \"Messiah\" or King that had been promised to the Jewish people, in the ancient Jewish books. Luke's Gospel tells most of the story. At the time that Jesus was born, the Roman Empire ruled most of Europe, England, the Middle East and North Africa. The Government wanted every single family to have their name taken down to be taxed, so everyone had to go back to the place where they came from. Joseph came from the small town of Bethlehem, near Jerusalem, so even though Mary was close to giving birth to her baby, they had to travel, with thousands of other people. When they got to Bethlehem, every room was full. There was nowhere for them to stay except in a stable, an animal shed. The baby Jesus was born in the stable, was wrapped up, and put to sleep on the straw in the feed bin (the \"manger\"). Luke tells us that the shepherds who were minding the sheep on the hillside came in to see the baby, and went away singing thanks to God for the newborn king. In \"the Gospel of Matthew\" it says that wise men from another country saw a new star in the sky and came to find the young Jesus because they knew that the \"Messiah\" was going to be born under a star, and that the star was a sign that Jesus was born to be a king. Jesus' ministry. The Gospels tell about the ministry of Jesus in this way:- When Jesus was aged about 30, he traveled around the country, teaching by telling stories. He taught that God alone was the true king, and that people should love God and love each other as the Hebrew Bible told them to do. Jesus performed miracles that were signs of God's power, such as giving hungry people food and wine, healing sick people, and making dead people alive again. He also set people free from evil spirits. Jesus gathered together twelve men, known as the \"Twelve Disciples\", whom he chose and trained to spread his message. He had many other disciples, including many women, but because of Jewish customs, the women disciples could not travel to distant places on their own as teachers. The Bible says Jesus became famous. He went to Jerusalem, where many people were visiting the city for a Holy Day. When they heard that he was coming, they greeted him as if he was a king. They thought perhaps he would free them from the Roman rule, but Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey, as a sign that he came in peace. Jesus did a lot of things that upset the Jewish religious leaders. He often showed disrespect for customs that the Jews had kept for many centuries. For example, Jews did no work at all on the 7th day of the week, the \"Sabbath\", because it was a holy day, but Jesus often showed disrespect for this custom. In John's Gospel, chapter 5, there is the story of Jesus healing a crippled man. Jesus saw a man lying on a mattress. He healed the man, and told him to pick up the mattress and go home. Carrying the mattress on the Sabbath was against religious custom, so the religious leaders argued with Jesus about it. They then watched everything he did, and remembered all the things that were against the religious customs. In Mark's Gospel, chapter 11, it says that when Jesus arrived in Jerusalem, he went to the Jewish Temple. He became angry at what he saw. There were people selling things there, and money lenders who were cheating poor people. Jesus chased away all the people who were selling things. He said the chief priests and scribes had turned the temple into a den of thieves because they were making money from the poor and taking away homes from poor women who had no other way to pay for the temple worship. Jesus' death. The Gospels tell about the death of Jesus in this way:- The temple leaders were angry and wanted to kill him. They told the Roman Government that Jesus wanted to become the king of the country and take it over. The Roman Governor thought that Jesus should be set free. The Jewish leaders said, \"If you do that, then you are not the friend of Caesar!\" (Caesar was the Roman ruler.) So the Governor sentenced him to death. The Roman soldiers killed Jesus by crucifixion; they nailed him to a cross by his arms. This was a common way for the Romans to kill rebels and criminals. Jesus' body was buried in a tomb which belonged to one of his followers. He was buried in a hurry, because the Sabbath day, when no one could work, started when the sun went down. On the day after the Sabbath, early in the morning, women came to wash the body and treat it with spice and perfumed oil. But the Gospels say that the body of Jesus was gone, and an angel sat by the tomb and said \"He is risen from the dead!\" (This is called the Resurrection.) Some people, like the disciple Thomas, said \"I'm not going to believe this, until I have seen it with my own eyes!\" But the Bible says that more than 500 people, including Thomas, saw Jesus alive again. There are many stories in \"the Gospels\" about what Jesus did once he was \"resurrected\". Finally, \"Luke's Gospel\" says that Jesus took his disciples to a hill, where he blessed them and told them to spread his teaching through all the world, and that then clouds came down, and he was lifted up to Heaven. Christian beliefs about Jesus and his teaching. The Christian Church is founded on Jesus. The things that Christians believe about Jesus are based on the four Gospels of the Bible, and on letters or \"Epistles\" that were written in the 1st century, explaining Jesus' teachings to his followers. Jesus did not write these letters. They were mainly written by a Jewish man called Paul, who worked for the Roman government. At first he tried to stop Christianity from spreading. Then he became a Christian himself and was an important leader. As Christian churches started in different towns and countries, Paul wrote letters to them. A lot of the ideas that Christians believe are written in Paul's letters. There is also lots of advice for running churches and families. There are many Christians who believe what Paul taught about Jesus but who do not agree with some of Paul's advice. There are other letters in the New Testament by other writers including Peter, James, and John. These letters all help to build the beliefs that modern Christians have. People of other faiths do not use the letters, and do not agree with the Christian teachings. See section: Other views about Jesus Jesus as God. Whether or not Jesus is God has been argued about for a long time. All Christians, including Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant Christians, believe Jesus was both God and man. Jesus is described in different parts of the New Testament as being \"the Word of God\", \"the Son of God\", \"the Son of Man\", and even God himself. These teachings, which are believed by most Christians, are not believed by many other people. The Islamic teaching is that Jesus was a prophet, but he was not part of God or the \"Son of God\". In Jesus' own time, many Jews became very angry at Jesus for saying that he was the \"Son of God\" and also because his followers said he was the \"Messiah\". Most Jews do not believe this. Jesus is also referred to as \"the Son of God\". Most Christians believe that these verses say Jesus is God. Most Christians believe that Jesus' death on the cross allows all people to be forgiven by God for their sins (bad things they have done). Most Christians believe that if a person asks God to forgive them He will do so, and they will get to live forever with him in Heaven. God in human form. Christians believe that, by the teaching of the Bible, Jesus was not only truly God but also truly human and that this was part of God's plan to bring humans closer to understanding him. People who do not have Christian beliefs, believe that Jesus was an ordinary person, and not God made human. In \"Matthew's Gospel\", Jesus is often called \"the Son of Man\". Matthew has borrowed these words from the Old Testament where they are often used to show that humankind is very far from God. In the Bible, God is often praised and thanked for helping ordinary humans, who are called \"the sons of man\". In Psalm 8, the writer, King David, asks God \"What is man and the son of man, that you should care so much and give him such wonderful power over the Earth and all its creatures?\" In Matthew's Gospel, 24:30 Jesus says \"..They shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of Heaven with power and great glory.\" Like King David, in Psalm 8, Jesus is making a difference between his ordinary human life and his great power as the \"Son of God\". \"The Good Shepherd\". In the Gospels, Jesus often spoke about himself as being like a shepherd, caring for sheep. He called himself the \"Good Shepherd\" who would even give his own life, to protect his sheep. He told the Jewish people, referring to non-Jewish or \"Gentile\" believers, that he had \"other sheep\" that do not belong to this flock. (John, 21:16). In one of his last conversations with his disciple Peter, he told him, \"Feed my sheep!\", in other words \"Take care of my people.\". \"The Holy Saviour\". In Jewish religion, from ancient times, there was a belief that humankind was \"sinful\" (did things that were bad) and that that people needed to be forgiven by God. They believed that there were two ways to get God's forgiveness, by prayer and by sacrifice. Prayer could be done anywhere, but sacrifices were done at the temple. A person would bring an animal, often a lamb, or if they were poor, a dove. They would put their hands on the animal to lay their sins on it. Then the animal would be killed, as a punishment for the sin. This type of sacrifice continued until the temple in Jerusalem was destroyed in 71 AD. Paying money to the temple was also a sort of sacrifice. When Jesus drove the traders out of the temple, they were the people who sold lambs and doves, and the people who exchanged Roman money into special temple money. Part of Christian belief is that Jesus Christ did not just come as a human person so that he could teach a better way of life. Christians also believe that Jesus was the \"ultimate\" sacrifice for the sin of humankind, that Jesus is the \"Saviour\": the one who is here to save. Christians believe that, unlike ordinary people, Jesus was completely pure and free from sin, but that when he died on the cross, he took on himself all the sins of every person in the whole world, like the lamb sacrificed in the temple. Based on John's Gospel, Christian teaching is that the death and resurrection of Jesus are the sign of his power to forgive the sins of any person who turns to him and truly asks for forgiveness. The Bible says that sinners who are forgiven should try to live a \"new life\" and not go back to their sinful behaviour. Christians believe that knowing about God's love helps people to live a new and better life. These are three verses from the Bible that are important in this Christian belief:- \"God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that, whoever believes might not die but have eternal life.\"' John's Gospel, 3:16. Jesus said: \"I am the way, the truth and the life. If anyone comes to the Father, they must come by me!\" John's Gospel, 14:6. \"If we say we have no sins, we are fooling ourselves and not telling the truth. But if we tell our sins humbly to God, then He has promised to listen and to forgive our sins and make us clean from all our badness.\" from the First Letter of John. Jesus as a teacher. Some people who are not Christians believe that Jesus lived at the time that the Gospels say, but do not believe that Jesus was the \"Son of God\" or \"Saviour\". They believe that Jesus was an ordinary, but very good person, a teacher and perhaps a prophet. Some people accept Jesus as a moral example without any connection to a God. Mohandas Gandhi said, \"I am a Muslim, and a Hindu, and a Christian, and a Jew,\" even though he was born a Jain. Gandhi worked hard in his life to make the followers of all these religions respect each other. This is how many people see Jesus, too - a teacher who said that all people were neighbours and that Jews, Romans, Greeks, Samaritans and other people should all live in peace with each other. Muslim beliefs about Jesus. Some people believe Jesus was a Prophet of God. Among these people are Muslims who follow the teaching of a book called the Qur'an. Muslims consider Jesus (under the name Isa) to be the second-to-last Prophet (messenger of God), and Muhammad to have been the very last Prophet. They believe that Jesus and Muhammad were both ordinary men. Muslims do not believe that Jesus was God or \"the Son of God\". They believe that Jesus cannot be part of God, because there is only one God. Muhammad taught that Jesus did not die on the cross, but that he went up to Heaven without dying. (The death of Jesus is essential to Christian belief about salvation.) Muslims always say \"peace be upon him\" after saying Jesus' name as a sign of respect. Jewish beliefs about Jesus. Even though Jesus was a Jew and his teaching came out of the Jewish religion, most Jewish people do not believe that Jesus was the \"Messiah\" that is promised in the Jewish Scriptures. In the Gospels, it tells that Jesus made the Jewish teachers very angry with his teachings. It says that part of their anger was because he told them they were \"hypocrites\" which means that they were pretending to live good lives but were really using the laws of their own religion to cheat people. In the Gospels, the other reason that they became angry was that Jesus acted as if he was the \"Messiah\", and said he was the \"Son of God\". This meant that he was either a terrible liar, that he was mad and just imagined it, or that it was true. But Jesus did not seem to be mad. So that left only two choices. If Jesus was lying, then he was doing something badly against the Jewish religion. It was because of the claims that Jesus was the \"Son of God\" that some of the Jewish leaders wanted him killed and they handed him to the Roman rulers. The Romans didn't care if Jesus said something that was against the Jewish beliefs. But they knew that people had also said that Jesus was \"King of the Jews\". This was against the government. Although, today and through history, most Jews do not believe what Christians say about Jesus, there are some Jews who do believe that Jesus was the \"Messiah\" promised in the Jewish Scriptures. Jews who believe this are called \"Messianic Jews\". Jesus as part of a false story. Some writers have said that perhaps Jesus never existed. Ideas have been put forward that the whole of the Gospel writing about Jesus is just a good story or myth and that Jesus perhaps never existed. Others have claimed that Jesus was really married to his follower, Mary Magdalene and that the Early Church leaders deliberately hid this information because it did not fit with the way that they wanted Jesus to be remembered. When a group of people deliberately hide information it is called a \"conspiracy\". One reason for this \"conspiracy theory\" is that there are a number of Early Christian writings which are different from the four Gospels of the New Testament. These include a \"Gospel of Thomas\", a \"Gospel of Philip\" and stories about Jesus as a child. These writings are all later than the four Biblical Gospels. The Gospel of Philip, which is a book of teachings from the 3rd century, talks about Mary Magdalene in a way that has sometimes been thought to mean that she was his wife. Most modern scholars of the Bible do not support this theory. They say that these early writings never say clearly that Jesus was married. Scholars say that although it was usual for men to be married (as it is today), many religious leaders and teachers (\"Rabbi\") were not married (like Catholic priests of today). One author, Dan Brown, has written a famous story, \"The da Vinci Code\" based on the idea that Jesus was really married to his female disciple, Mary Magdalene, and that the church has been hiding this information. Many people believe what Dan Brown wrote, even though his book is fiction. Some archaeologists have found a tomb in Jerusalem where there are graves with the names of a family called Joseph, Mary, Jesus, Jacob and Mary. They say that it must be the grave of Jesus' family, even though the Bible mentions 8 different Josephs, 5 Marys, 3 Joshua/Jesus and 4 Jacobs. Jesus as part of an old tradition. Other writers have shown that parts of the story of Jesus are similar to other religions such as the stories of Gilgamesh and Mithras. They also show that Christianity holds its main Holy Days at a time when there was already a Roman or Jewish festival such as Easter at the time of the Passover. How the Gospels were written. In the later part of the 20th century and in the 21st century nearly all scholars, both Christian and non-Christian agree that Jesus was a real historic person. Both Christian and non-Christian scholars base their studies of him on the Gospels. They are believed to have been written between 60-90 AD. One of the main reasons that most scholars believe in the real existence of Jesus is that \"someone\" in the 1st century AD must have lived and taught the things which Jesus taught. Some real person must have started the Christian Church. Whether or not that person was called Jesus, their ideas were so powerful that they changed the world. By tradition, \"the Gospels\" were written by four men, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John who gave their names to these books. This is the order in which they are arranged in the New Testament of the Bible, but scholars think that it is not the order in which they were written. \"The Gospel of Mark\" was probably written before \"the Gospel of Matthew\". The four Gospels all tell the story of the Life of Jesus, but they do it from four different points of view, because they were written by different people and each writer had reasons to tell it in a different way. Other scholars have said that leaders in the Early Christian Church made changes to the Gospel writings. These changes are said to have happened at different times, in different ways and for different reasons. For example, one story was left out of many old versions of the Gospels. It is about Jesus rescuing a woman who had committed adultery (had sex outside marriage) and was about to be killed. St. Augustine of Hippo, (354-430 AD) wrote that this was probably was left out because some church leaders thought the story might cause people to act in a sinful way. This story is in all modern Bibles and is thought to contain very important teaching for Christians. Other differences that can be found in versions of the Gospels are mostly small and do not make a difference to what is known about the life of Jesus and his teaching. About Mark. Mark's Gospel, which is thought by biblical scholars to be the earliest, has the name of a young disciple of the apostle Paul who is mentioned several times in the \"Acts of the Apostles\" and Paul's Letters.The Gospel was probably written in Rome and is thought by scholars to be from the memories of Jesus' follower or \"disciple\", Peter. It doesn't tell about Jesus' birth; it starts when he was 30 year old, at the time when the disciples got to know him. It shows Jesus as a man of action: going around the country, teaching and healing people. About Matthew. Matthew's Gospel was written next. Matthew was one of Jesus' disciples. He was a Jewish man that was hated by other Jews because he worked for the Roman rulers as a tax collector. Matthew tells that one day Jesus saw him sitting at his desk in the market place and said \"Follow me!\". Most Biblical scholars believe that Matthew had read Mark's Gospel and decided to fill in some things that Mark left out, because, while Mark wrote his Gospel for the Church of Rome, Matthew wanted to write for Jewish Christians all over the Roman Empire. Matthew was a well-educated Jew, so he knew the Jewish Scriptures, (which Christians also use and call the Old Testament of the Bible). Matthew knew the scripture teachings that the Messiah, or God's anointed one would come. In his Gospel, he often mentions these teachings. He also starts off by giving a list of Jesus' ancestors because this was important to Jewish readers. About Luke. The apostle Luke was Greek and a friend of the apostle Paul. He was a doctor and often writes about medical things. Luke came to know about Jesus from the \"disciples\". Luke writes about the birth and the childhood of Jesus and he says \"Mary kept all these things in her heart and thought about them.\" Luke was not a Jew and he writes in a way that is easy for other people who are not Jews to understand. He explains Jewish customs and laws. He wrote a second book called \"the Acts of the Apostles\" which tells what the disciples did after Jesus had left them. About John. It is believed by scholars of the Bible that John was a \"disciple\" of Jesus and was probably the youngest of the twelve men who were Jesus' main followers. He lived to be an old man and, because of his teaching about Jesus, he was sent to a small island, Patmos. In his old age he wrote two important books, of which one is \"John's Gospel\". John writes with one particular idea in mind. He wants to prove to the reader that Jesus is God's way of saving humans from the terrible problem of sin or \"evil\". John starts by telling the reader that Jesus was (and is) God. John says that Jesus is God's \"Living Communication\" (or \"Living Word\"). Every part of \"John's Gospel\" is written to show that Jesus came from God, taught the \"Message of God\" and is the way for people to understand \"God's Love\". Jesus' teachings and stories. The Gospels tell many of the stories that Jesus told when he was teaching people about the way that God loved them and the way they should live. Two of the most famous stories are the story of \"the Prodigal Son\" and the story of \"the Good Samaritan\". In the first story it is shown how much God loves his people and in the second story is shown how people should love each other. The Prodigal Son. In this story from Luke's Gospel, Jesus tells how a rich man had two sons. They would both get a share of his money, when he died. The younger son said, \"Father, give me my money now, so I can go and enjoy myself, while I'm young.\" He took the money to the city, and spent it all on parties with his friends. Soon he had none left to feed himself. He was ashamed. He got a job caring for pigs, but he was almost starving. He said to himself, \"I'll go home to my father and I will say 'Father, I have sinned! Please let me be a servant in your house!'\" As he went home, he did not know that his father looked out for him, every day. When his father saw him coming, he ran along the road to put his arms around his son. The son said \"Father, I have sinned! Please let me be a servant in your house!\" The father said \"Bring the finest clothes! Kill the fattest calf to make a feast!\" When the elder brother heard all this, he was angry and said \"I'm a good son to you, but you never even gave me one little goat to have a party with my friends!\" The father said \"You have always been with me. I love you greatly, and and all I have is yours, but my son who was lost is now found! My son who seemed to be dead is alive! Be happy with me!\" Jesus said that this is the way God loves and forgives his people, when they ask for forgiveness. The Good Samaritan. In this story from Luke's Gospel, Jesus shows what it means to be a good neighbour. Near the Jews lived the Samaritans. They followed the Hebrew Scriptures, but they worshiped differently to the Jews, so the Jews were prejudiced against them. One day, a Jewish man was on a journey when a band of robbers beat him up, robbed him and left him naked and almost dead, by the road. A Jewish priest came along and saw him. He thought, \"If I touch that naked bleeding man, I will be unclean and I won't be able to go to the Temple!\" So he pretended that he hadn't seen him. Another Jew, a Holy Man, came along and acted in the same way. At last a Samaritan came along with a donkey. When he saw the wounded man he stopped. He washed his wounds with wine and olive oil. Then he put him on his donkey and took him to the nearest inn. He paid the innkeeper and said \"Keep him until he is well, and whatever is owing, I will pay when I come back this way.\" Jesus said to the people who were listening \"Which one of these people acted like a good neighbour?\" They said \"He that stopped and helped.\" Jesus said \"You go and act the same way.\"",
   "Helium": "Helium is a chemical element. It has the chemical symbol He and atomic number 2. Helium is called a noble gas, because it does not regularly mix with other chemicals and form new compounds. It has the lowest boiling point of all the elements. It is the second most common element in the universe, after hydrogen, and has no color or smell. Helium does not usually react with anything else. However, it can react with tungsten, iodine, fluorine, sulfur and phosphorus under very special conditions. Pierre Janssen and Norman Lockyer found helium in 1868. They found that it was in the Sun before it was found on Earth. Because of where it was found, its name comes from the Greek word for Sun, \"helios\". It is used to fill balloons and airships because it is lighter than air, and does not burn or react, meaning it is normally safe for using it in that way. It is also used in some kinds of light bulbs. People also breathe it in to make their voices sound higher than they normally do as a joke, but this is extremely dangerous if they breath in too much, since it can kill them, since they are not breathing normal air. Breathing too much helium can also cause long-term effects to vocal cords.",
   "Wave (physics)": "A wave is a type of change that moves from one place to another. Properties of Waves. Sine waves can be measured too. The shape of a sine wave is given by its amplitude, phase, wavelength and frequency. The speed that the sine wave moves can be measured. The amplitude and wavelength of the sine wave is shown in the picture. The highest point on a wave is called the peak. Though lowest point is called the trough. The peak of a wave and the trough of a wave are always twice the wave's amplitude apart from each other. The part of the wave half way in between the peak and the trough is called the baseline. All waves are made by adding up sine waves. Waves also have amplitudes, phases, wavelengths, frequencies and speeds that can be measured. Waves and Matter. Some waves can move through matter while others cannot. For instance, some waves can move through empty space, light waves for example. Sound waves, on the other hand, cannot move through empty space. Inherently, all waves carry energy from one place to another when they move. In some applications of technology, waves may carry meaningful information from one place to another, such as radio technology. Usually, after a wave moves through matter, the matter is the same as it was before the wave was introduced, though in some cases, matter can be affected by waves traveling through it. In 1922, Louuituitiriy omar gtuis de Broglie found out that waves all waves are also particles, and all particles are also waves. Some Types of Waves. Light waves can move through space. When light waves move through space, there are no particles to move. Sunlight gets to the earth by moving through space. Sunlight brings the earth energy and information.",
   "Paper": "Paper is a thin sheet of fibers pressed together. People write on paper, and books are made of paper. Paper can absorb liquids such as water, and so people can clean things with paper. Paper making. Paper is normally made from the wood of trees. Wood is ground up and mixed with water and other chemicals to make a thin liquid called \"paper pulp\". Paper pulp can be bleached, to make black paper, or dyes can be added to make colored paper. This pulp is pressed into sheets of paper. When the sheets are dry, they are cut into pieces of paper. Sometimes paper is made glossy (shiny) by adding clay or other materials. Sometimes paper is made from other kinds of paper. This is an example of recycling. Not all paper is made from wood. Other kinds of fiber can be used also. People make paper from cotton, linen, and hemp. Uses of paper. Paper is used for writing and printing. Books, magazines and newspapers are printed on paper. Paper is often used for money. Paper used for money is often made in very special ways, to make it hard for people to print their own money. A piece of paper money is called a banknote, a bill, or a note. Paper can be used for cleaning. Special forms of paper are used, such as paper towels, facial tissues, or toilet paper. Pretty paper can be used as decoration. It can be pasted onto the walls of a room; this is called wallpaper. Paper can be used to wrap gifts. This is called wrapping paper or gift wrap. Some kinds of paper are strong and can be used in boxes and other packaging material. Sometimes several layers of paper are held together with glue, to make cardboard. History of paper. Many centuries ago\u00a0\u2013\u00a0as early as 3000 BC\u00a0\u2013\u00a0people in Egypt made a kind of paper from the papyrus plant. This is where the word \"paper\" comes from. The people of Greece and Rome learned to do this too. Around the year 105, a man in China named Ts'ai Lun thought of a way to make paper from cotton rags. People in Japan learned how to do this with fiber from the mulberry tree, in the year 610. After that these were developed into a type of paper made in Japan. This is called Japanese paper or Washi. This Chinese discovery spread to India, and then to the Middle East, and then to Italy. A chance of spreading to the Middle East was The Battle of Talas in 751. Then army of the Arabs captured soldiers of the Chinese. There were paper maker in the captive soldiers. In 757 a paper mill was built at Samarkand. Middle Eastern people learned to use linen as paper raw material and to use starch made from flour as chemical additive. These papers were widely well-known in the Middle East. The Italians used hemp and linen rags. In 1276 the first Italian paper mill was built at Fabriano and until 14 century Italy became a paper supplier in Europe. In 1282 the first watermark was introduced in Bologna. Paper was hard to make, and it cost a lot of money. In the 19th century, new machines were made that could make paper out of wood fibers. This helped to make paper cheap enough for everyone to buy. Around the same time, other inventions were made, like the pencil, the fountain pen, and a printing press that used steam power. Because of these new things, it was easy for people to write letters, to buy books and newspapers, and to keep records of what they did. Today some of the largest paper-producing countries are USA, Canada, Finland, Sweden and Russia. Paper is produced in large factories called \"paper mills\". They can produce hundreds of thousands of tonnes of paper each year.",
   "Condensation": "Condensation is the process in which water vapour changes into a water droplet or ice crystal. Condensation is an important part of the water cycle. Process. Condensation of water is when water turns from gas to a liquid or crystal shape. Any gas can condensate, usually at a low temperatures or high pressure. However, condensation can technically happen at any temperature, so long as the pressure of the condensing gas is more than than the pressure of the liquid state of that gas (both at the same temperature). Process in nature. Condensation is vital in nature and is always the same as temperature and vapour pressure in nature. This means that if there is a lot of condensation, the temperature goes up. Alternatively, if there is hardly any condensation, there will be a temperature loss. Process in industry. It is a process that can be useful to man. One use is in the creation of \u201cnew water\u201d (drinkable water made from drinkable sources). Problems. However, since there is a temperature gain when a lot of condensation happens, the heat needs to be \"removed\", which can be troublesome and expensive.",
   "CNN": "Cable News Network (CNN) is a national news service on television in the United States of America. It was started by Ted Turner and its headquarters are in Atlanta, Georgia. It is one of the most watched networks in the United States. It was the first network to air news 24 hours a day.",
   "Soap": "Most kinds of soap are chemical compounds containing sulfates. When combined with water during bathing or washing, they help people and clothes get clean by reducing the ability of dirt and oil to hang onto skin or fabric. Soaps are made from animal fats or vegetable oils. Soap cleans very well in soft water. It is non-toxic to water life. It can be broken down by bacteria. However, soap is only slightly soluble in water, so it is seldom used in washing machines. It does not work well in hard water. It cannot be used in strongly acidic solutions. Man has used soap for at least 2000 years.",
   "Scalar": "Scalars are simple numbers.They are used for measuring things. Many things can be measured, and the measure can be explained by only giving the number. Suppose we are measuring a rod. We could give the measured length as 2 metres or 3 cm etc. depending on the length of the rod under observation. Here only the figure 2 or 3 along with the unit of measure is enough to transmit information about the rod. i.e. mass is measured by scalars, distances are measured by scalars. The other family of measurement falls under the category of vectors.",
   "Chemistry": "Chemistry [kem'-ihs-tree] is the science of \"chemical elements\" and \"compounds\", and how these things work together. It is the study of the materials (things) that make up our bodies and everything in the world around us. Chemistry began as a true science during the 1600s. This is when chemists discovered the simplest substances that make up all other substances. These simple substances are called \"elements\". For a long time before that, people were trying to study these things to figure out how to do things like turn lead into gold, but no one ever did. This was called alchemy [al-kem-mee]. A chemical \"compound\" is a substance made up of two or more \"elements\". Things studied in chemistry. Chemical compounds -- Chemical elements -- Physical change -- Chemical change -- Physical property -- Chemical property -- Scientific method -- SI base unit Chemical formula -- Chemical bond -- Chemical equation -- Chemical reaction",
   "Antarctica": "Antarctica is a large continent located at the far south of the world. It is larger than Europe. The weather there is extremely cold. About 98% of Antarctica is covered with ice. Very few people live there, except in the small towns of McMurdo and Palmer on the coast. There is a science station at the South Pole where experiments are carried out. These experiments are to do with the weather and outer space exploration. People who want to go to Antarctica usually fly there. However, it is also possible to book tourist cruises to visit the continent. These depart from Ushuaia, which is in southern Argentina. Antarctica is the only continent with no countries in it. By international treaty, none of the land in Antarctica belongs to any country. There are very few plants in Antarctica; the only large air-breathing animals are penguins, seals, and whales. Antarctica is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Indian Ocean, but more recently, the seas right around it have together been called the Southern Ocean. The next nearest continent is South America. In Antarctica, it is always dark during the winter, but in the summer the sun shines 24 hours a day. There is one volcano in Antarctica. It is named Mount Erebus. Mount Ereubus is very high.",
   "Prison": "A prison is an building where people who have been guilty and convicted of crimes are held. People are part of the criminal justice system of a country. Being sent to prison (which is called \"imprisonment\") is legal penalty that the state can give a person who is convicted of a crime by a court. Prisons are run by the state (government). People held in prisons are called inmates or convicts. Other words for prison include \"penitentiary\", \"jail\" or \"gaol\" (pronounced like \"jail\"), and \"correctional facility\". A person who has been charged with a crime may be sent to prison if the court thinks that the person may not come to their trial, or if the court thinks that the person may be a risk to the community. In some countries, prisons are also used for political prisoners (people who disagree with the country's leader or government). In times of war, prisoners of war may also be held in prisons. Prison buildings and facilities. Male and female inmates are usually kept in separate locations or in separate prisons. Prisons are usually surrounded by walls and gates. There are usually many locked gates inside the prison to control the inmates. The inmates sleep in small locked rooms called cells. Cells have a bunk bed, a toilet, and a sink. Inmates are allowed to leave their cell every day for exercise. Some inmates work in the prison during the day, either in a factory or doing cooking or cleaning. Law enforcement officers called prison guards watch the inmates. The manager of a prison is called the warden. Prisons usually also include other buildings and facilities, such as a chapel, a library, an exercise yard, a gymnasium, an infirmary (small hospital), visiting rooms (for visits from family and lawyers), kitchens, and accommodation for prison staff. Prisons for young people. There are special prisons for people under the age of 18 who commit crimes. These inmates are called young offenders or juvenile offenders. Controversy. Prisons are a controversial topic that people have different views about. Number of people in prison. As of 2006, there are nine million people are currently in prison in the world. The United States currently has the most people in prison; there are more than 2 million people in prison.In 2002, both Russia and China also had over 1 million people in prison. In 2003, the United Kingdom had 73,000 people in prison; France and Germany having a similar number of people in prison. Cultural references to prisons and prison life. There are many books and poems about prisons or prison life, such as \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" by Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re and \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\" by Oscar Wilde. There have also been television programs, such as Prisoner (1979-1986) and Prison Break (2005-present).",
   "Chat": "To chat is to talk about ordinary things that are not very important. You can chat to one person or to many people. People also use this word now for parts of the Internet where we can talk with many different people at the same time. Usually, you chat on the Internet in a chat room or messaging service like AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), Yahoo Messenger Windows Live Messenger or Tencent QQ. There are also programs which which let you use different messaging services from one program, such as Pidgin.",
   "Reward": "A reward is getting something good for doing a given task. It needs someone who has the power to give the good thing. It is the opposite of punishment. Ideas like risk and reward, reward and punishment are based on the idea that people do things, or avoid doing things, to get rewards. In psychology there is another idea that this is not true. This other idea says that training (conditioning) and emotions (affective factors) are much more important than the rewards or punishments given by others. In trying to catch criminals and other bad people, the government often offers money to people. This money is given to people who may capture the criminal, or give information that helps the police catch them. For example after the Eureka Stockade rebellion in Ballarat, Victoria in 1854, the government offered a big reward of 400 pounds for the capture of the people who had started it. In 2001, the US government offered a big reward of 2.5 million dollars for help in capturing the person who had sent anthrax in letters to a newspaper journalist and 2 senators. Anthrax is a disease which can kill people.",
   "Polymer": "A polymer is a material which has larger molecules made from joining together many small molecules called monomers. The word \"polymer\" can be broken down into \"poly\" (meaning \"many\") and \"mer\" (meaning \"unit\"). This shows how the chemical composition of a polymer consists of many smaller units (monomers) bonded together into a larger molecule. A chemical reaction bonding monomers together to make a polymer is called polymerization. Some polymers are natural. Proteins have polypeptide molecules, which are natural polymers made from various amino acid monomer units. Nucleic acids are natural polymers made up of nucleotide units. Cellulose and starch are also natural polymers made up of glucopyranose monomer bonded together in different ways. Some polymers are man-made. Plastics, rubber, and fibers are made up of polymers. Make up of polymers. If the \"units\" called monomers in a polymer are all the same, then the polymer is called a \"homopolymer\". Homopolymers are named by adding the prefix poly- before the monomer name from which the polymer is made. For example, a polymer made by bonding styrene monomer molecules together is called polystyrene. If the \"units\" are not all the same, the polymer is called a \"copolymer\" or a \"heteropolymer\". Many polymer molecules are like \"chains\" where the monomer units are the links. Polymer molecules can be straight-chain, have \"branching\" from the main chain, or \"cross-linking\" between chains. For an example of cross-linking, sulfhydryl (-S-H) groups in two cysteine amino acid units in polypeptide chains can bond together to make a disulfide bridge (-S-S-) joining the chains together.",
   "Gautama Buddha": "Siddh\u0101rta Gautama was the name of the person who began the religion of Buddhism. He lived from about 563 BCE to about 483 BCE. He was the most recent Buddha, and some people just call him \"the Buddha\". He is also called Sakyamuni or Tath\u0101gata. Some \"Buddhists\" believe that Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama was a perfect person. The life of Siddh\u0101rta Gautama. There are many old stories about the life of the \"Buddha\". No one knows which stories are true and which stories are made up. But most historians think that the Buddha was a real person. He was very kind and wise and wanted to change the world. His early years. Old stories say that Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama was born in the kingdom of Kapilavastu in Nepal. At that time, a clan called the Sakyas ruled Kapilavastu. His father was a king named Suddodana Gautama, and his mother was the beautiful Mahamaya. Siddh\u0101rtha lived in luxury; his father kept trouble and hard work far from him. A \"seer\" said that Siddh\u0101rtha would become either a great king or a great holy man. (A seer is a wise man who can see the future.) The king did not want his son to become a holy man. He believed if he always kept Siddh\u0101rtha happy, he would not want to become a holy man. So his father never let Siddharta outside the palace. When he was older, his father found a woman for Siddh\u0101rtha to marry at the age of 16. He married the woman named Yashodhara, and they had a son, Rahula. Although Gautama had everything he could want, he still was not happy. He wanted to learn the meaning of his existence. He got out of the castle against his fathers orders. He saw the \"Four Passing Sights\": an old crippled man, a sick man, a dead man, and a holy man with no home. Right then, Gautama knew that nothing can stop people from being born, becoming old, getting sick, and dying. He decided to give up his worldly life. He would not keep his wife, his child, his wealth, or his palace. He would become a holy man with no home. He would look for the answer to the problem of birth, old age, sickness, and death. He left his home in the middle of the night. He looked at his family one last time. He did not return for a very long time. Seeking Answers. At that time, holy men were usually \"ascetics\". They hurt their bodies in order to help their \"spiritual\" beings. They do not do things they like so they can defeat their desires. The most \"ascetic\" kinds of holy men were called Jains. They practiced self-denial and made themselves suffer very much. They believed this would free the \u0101tman (soul) from pain and sadness. Siddh\u0101rtha did these things well. Eventually he was better than his teachers. He still found no answer, and he left his teachers. Some friends and he went even further. He ate only one grain of rice a day. He tried not breathing. He became just skin and bones, and he nearly died. Still, he had no answer. Siddh\u0101rtha started to think again about this path. He thought there might be a better way than hurting himself. He found a big tree (now called the \"Bodhi tree\") and started to meditate. He told himself that he would not get up until he had found \"enlightenment\". His mind is said to have become pure, and then, six years after he began his path, he said he found Enlightenment, and became the first Buddha. The Life as the first Buddha. When the Buddha became \"enlightened\", he knew the answer to \"suffering\", and he knew how to defeat \"suffering\". This answer was called the Four Noble Truths. He was not sure if he should teach his new ideas or not. He asked himself if the world was ready for such a deep teaching. But in the end, he decided to travel to a town called Sarnath to teach the people his new way. He taught about the \"Four Noble Truths\" and the Noble Eightfold Path. The people listened to him, and began to follow him. When he taught, he did not pretend to be a god. He said he was just a man who had found \"enlightenment\", and that any person can also find \"enlightenment\". For the rest of his life, he walked all over Southern Nepal and parts of India to teach people his new way. He started a \"Sangha\", which is a group of Buddhist monks and nuns. Many people became \"enlightened\" because of him. At the age of 80, Gautama Buddha died. The Buddha's last words were, \"All things must end. Work hard for your own enlightenment\". The Life Teachings. The teachings of the Buddha are known as \"Buddhism\". Buddhism is mostly about ending the feeling of pain that all people feel inside. Gautama Buddha taught that pain is a part of all life. He taught that pain is because of desire. And he showed that there is a way to end desire and end pain by doing good things, not doing bad things, and training one's mind. This is done to end pain and gain \"enlightenment\". Buddhism teaches non-harm and \"moderation\" or balance, not going too far one way or the other. The Buddha taught people to meditate, or think deeply, while sitting in a special way. Some Buddhist chant and meditate while walking. Buddhists sometimes do these things to understand the human heart and mind. Sometimes they do these things to understand the way the world works. Sometimes they do these things to find peace. The Buddha would not say if gods exist or not. He taught that people should not look to gods to save them or bring them enlightenment. The gods may have power over world events and they might help people, or they might not. But it's up to each person to become \"enlightened\".",

   "Military": "The military is the men and women who work in the army, navy, air force, or other armed forces of a country. The military protects its country by defending it from the armed forces of enemies, if there is a war. The military can also be ordered by the government of the country to attack another country. The word \"military\" comes from Latin \"miles\", warrior. People in the military learn many skills, such as how to fire rifles and mortars, drive jeeps, and repair weapons. Other people in the military learn how to fly planes, pilot ships, or repair engines. People in the military usually wear clothes called a uniform, which is often in a camouflage pattern which is designed to make the person hard to see in the forest or desert. There are two ways to join the military. In many countries, people join the military as volunteers (because they want to). In other countries, there are laws that some people have to be in the military, even if they do not want to be. This is called \"the draft\" or \"conscription\". It usually depends on age and fitness. People who have been in the military but have left or retired are called \u201cveterans\u201d. Joining up and training. In most countries of the world, young men and (in a few countries) women between 17 and 18 and of good health may be forced by the government of their country to join the military and have military training. This is called \"conscription\". The countries that do not have conscription include Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, France, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Malta, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, United Kingdom and United States. In some countries, such as Argentina, conscription is legal, but is not used, at the present time. When a person wants to join the military as a volunteer, they \"enlist\". (This means simply that they put their name on a list.) They have to be above a certain age, 17 or 18 in most countries. They have to pass fitness tests to show that they are well enough to do the jobs that they will have to do. They must also have good enough hearing, to hear instructions and good enough sight to use a rifle. New people in the military are often called \u201crecruits\u201d. They have training at a special camp, sometimes called \u201cboot camp\u201d. During this training, the recruits usually have very little free time. They learn to understand the \"orders\" or \"commands\" that are given by the officers to the \"troops\". (The troops are the military people in a group.) They learn the right ways to obey the orders. They do a lot of exercise to improve their fitness and strength. They learn about weapons, first aid, and their uniforms and \"kit\". (Their kit is their equipment.) Recruits also learn how to march. (This is the way to walk together, keeping \"in step\".) Learning to march is sometimes called \u201cdrill\u201d. By the time soldiers finish \"boot camp\", they should know enough to be a helpful person in their group. The camp usually finishes with a parade in which the newly trained recruits show off their marching and other skills they have learnt to important visitors. Once the recruits are fully trained, they are ready to defend (protect) their country from attack, or to go to war, if necessary. Groups. Each part of the armed forces, the army, the navy and the airforce, is organized into groups. People in each of the armed forces are part of a group, that is part of a larger group. Ranks in the United States military. All branches of the US military have both Officers and Enlisted. Enlisted people with a rank of E-4 and above are called Non-commissioned Officers (NCOs). It is usually their job to make sure that common jobs are done properly every day. Each branch also includes \"Warrant Officers\" (\"Chief Warrant Officers\" in the Navy). These were enlisted members who have been made officers. They are considered experts in their field, they are higher rank than other enlisted troops, but below officers. There are four ranks of Warrant Officers: WO-1 through WO-4 (CWO-1 to CWO-4) US military. Here are some common ranks for the US Army, Air Force and Marines. Each branch of the military uses different names for the enlisted ranks, but they all use the same for officers. US Navy. The Navy has different ranks. and class. For example, a Electronics Technician (ET) who is an E-5 is called an Electronics Technician 2nd class (ET2)",

   "Union of Soviet Socialist Republics": "The Soviet Union (short for Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)) was a group of countries that came together (a federation). The federation was originally led by Vladmir Lenin and was a major, powerful country. The largest of these countries was Russia, followed by Ukraine. The capital city of the Soviet Union was Moscow. The Soviet Union existed from 1922 to 1991. The nation's government said that it was a socialist country that wanted communism. \"Sovjets\", or workers' councils, were created to \"speak\" for the workers, and served as an elite group to control the workers. Republics of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was made of 15 republics. These were either \"Soviet Socialist Republics\", or \"Soviet Socialist Federal Republics\". Each of these republics was independent. It also had the right to leave the union. The \"Federal Republics\" were different in that they had more autonomy, and were made up of states themselves. These were often called \"Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics\". There were a number of them. Most of them still exist; though they are now republics, within the independent state. The \"Tatar ASSR\" turned into the \"Republic of Tatarstan\", for example (It is located around Kazan. Tatars make up 3.8% of the population of Russia)",
   "Subtraction": "Subtraction is the arithmetic operation for finding the difference between two numbers. The special names of the numbers in a subtraction expression are, minuend \u2212 subtrahend = difference. The expression 7 \u2212 4 = 3 can be spoken as \"seven minus four equals three,\" \"seven take away four leaves three,\" or \"four from seven leaves three.\" If the minuend is less than the subtrahend, the difference will be a negative number. For example, 17 \u2212 25 = (\u22128). We can say this as, \"Seventeen minus twenty-five equals negative eight.\" This is how cash registers determine the change you receive when you pay with more money than your purchase costs.",
   "Slovakia": "Slovakia (Slovak: \"Slovensko\")(Official name The Slovak Republic, \"Slovensk\u00e1 republika\") is a country with no access to the ocean in central Europe.

The Celts started to settle since 450 BC. The coins named \"Biatec\" represent the first use of writing in Slovakia. At the turn of millenniums, various Germanic tribes like Quadi and Marcomanni started to overtake the area. The Roman Empire established a series of outposts along the Danube river. They even fought Germanic tribes, with the most northern presence being in Tren\u010d\u00edn (\"Laugaritio\"), during the Marcomannic Wars. The Great Moravia was at first in constant quarrels with the Eastern Francia, and at the beginning of the 10th century, with the Magyars who arrived from Asia. The Magyars beat the Great Moravia in 906, overtook the area and established the Hungarian Principality, resulting later in the creation of the Kingdom of Hungary in year 1000. Slovak settlements continued to be in the north, while those of the Hungarians were in the south. A huge population loss resulted from the Mongol invasions in 1241. The Hungarian kings started to invite other settlers, for example Germans in the 13th century, and many others started to arrive in the kingdom, Vlachs from Romania in the 14th century and Jews. The expansion of the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century from the south, who occupied the two most important towns in the kingdom, Buda (capital) and Szekesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r (coronation capital) and southern regions, the center shifted to Slovakia and the capitals moved to Bratislava (\"Pressburg\", \"Pozsony\" at that time). The fights against the Ottomans and an uprising against the Habsburgs caused a lot of destruction. After the Ottomans started to retreat back from Hungary Bratislava continued to be capital until 1848, when it was moved back to Budapest. The creation of the dual monarchy Austria-Hungary gave free hand to the Magyars, and Slovaks until 1918 were under cultural repressions from the Hungarian government, limiting the Slovak language, and promoting its Magyarisation policy. The area was a part of Czechoslovakia from 1918 to 1992. Czechoslovakia became independent from the Austrian-Hungarian Empire in 1918. The first Czechoslovakian president was Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk. Czechoslovakia split for the first time in 1938/1939, when Slovakia, with Hitler's help, became independent, though all the time until 1945, the end of the World War II was puppet ally of the Nazi Germany. Czechoslovakia was once again created in 1945, where the Communists took rule in 1948 and ruled until 1989, when the series of events, called Velvet Revolution overthrown them. Soviet inspired Czechoslovakia peacefully split into two countries (Slovakia and Czech Republic) on January 1 1993, in what became known as the Velvet Divorce. Slovakia has been a member of the European Union since May 1, 2004. Geography. Slovakia is noted primarily for its mountainous nature, with the Carpathian Mountains being in the north and various lowlands mostly in the south. The highest mountain range are the Tatra mountains with the highest peak, the Gerlachov Peak (2,654 m). Major Slovak rivers besides the Danube are the V\u00e1h and Hron. The Slovak climate is temperate, with warm summers and cloudy, cold and humid winters. Demographics. About 5.4 million people live in Slovakia. Most people speak Slovak (86%), but in southern regions of Slovakia people speak also Hungarian (9%), with some municipalities even being with the Hungarian majority (for example, Kom\u00e1rno or Dunajsk\u00e1 Streda), Ruthenian or Ukrainian are spoken in the northeast. A minority Roma population speak versions of the Romany language and are scattered mainly in the east. The Slovak constitution guarantees a freedom of religion. The majority of Slovaks are Roman Catholics (69%), the next are the atheists (13%). Other religions include Lutheranism, Greek Orthodox and Calvinism. There are about 5,000 Muslims in Slovakia and 2,000 of Jews. Administrative division. These are further divided into many districts. There are currently 79 districts of Slovakia.",
   "Niihau": "Niihau is the smallest of the inhabited islands of Hawaii, in the United States. It has a land area of 70 sq. miles (184 sq. km). It is the oldest of the eight main islands. The whole island is owned by the Robinson family. They bought it from the Kingdom of Hawaii for $10,000. It was said that the buyer, Elizabeth Sinclair (later Sinclair-Robinson), liked the island better than other places such as Waikiki, Pearl Harbor, and the island of Lanai. There is a small US Navy base where a handful of Navy people work. The island has a few hundred permanent inhabitants. Almost all of them are native Hawaiians. They support themselves largely with small family farms. Many work for the ranch owned by the Robinsons. The native Hawaiians lead a rural, low-tech life. They speak the Hawaiian language and keep traditions alive. This is because Ms. Sinclair promised to help preserve Hawaiian culture and tradition when she bought the island. Niihau is the only one of the Hawaiian islands where the Hawaiian language is the main language. Niihau is also known as the \"Forbidden Island\". This is due to the fact that until recently, the island was off-limits to all but family members, US Navy personnel, government officials and expressly invited guests. Now, tourists can go on one of a limited number of supervised tours or hunting safaris. On the beaches of the island are found shells which are the only shells to be classified as gems. Niihau shells and the jewelry made from them are very popular. Many, especially those with darker and richer color, are collectors items.

God keep our land glorious and free! O Canada, we stand on guard for thee; O Canada, we stand on guard for thee. Here are the words in French. The words in French and English do not mean the same thing. \u00d4 Canada! Terre de nos a\u0129eux, Ton front est ceint de fleurons glorieux! Car ton bras sait porter l'\u00e9p\u00e9e, Et ta valeur de foi tremp\u00e9e Prot\u00e9gera nos foyers et nos droits; Prot\u00e9gera nos foyers et nos droits.",
   "Ireland": "Ireland is an island of Europe off the west coast of the European mainland. To the west of Ireland is the Atlantic Ocean; to the east of Ireland, across the Irish Sea, is the island of Great Britain. The island of Ireland, called \"\u00c9ire\" (\"Ae-ra\") in the Irish language, is about long and about wide. Six million people live in Ireland. The River Shannon, which runs from north to south, is the longest river. Ireland has many lakes (or Loughs). Lough Neagh, in Northern Ireland, is the largest lake in Ireland, or the British Isles. Ireland is known for its beautiful landscapes, history, and mythology. The capital of the Republic of Ireland is called Dublin. It is in the east of the country and built on the river Liffey. More than one million people live in Dublin.",
   "Medium": "A medium is the way or means information is sent or received. Paper is a common \"medium\", used every day by millions of people. Television is another very common medium; it is said that there is not a community on Earth where at least one family does not own a television. The plural form of \"medium\" is \"media\", so radio and television are both types of broadcast media, but paint, charcoal, ink, and clay are types of artistic media. When people buy or sell things, the \"medium\" is often coins or paper money, but it may also be shells, gems, livestock, or even an agreement to perform a service in the future. A medium is also a person who it is said can pass messages between the living and the dead. This type of medium was quite popular in the West in the 19th century, but most were found to be dishonest and few remain today. In Taoism, mediums still work. However, the power of mediums is mostly believed by the superstitious. Medium is also a size, coming between small and large. Other words used in this way include \"intermediate\", \"average\", and \"middle\".",
   "Botany": "Botany is a science. It is a branch of biology, and is also called plant biology. It is sometimes called phytology. Botany is the study of plants. Scientists who study botany are called botanists. They want to learn about how plants work.",
   "Devil": "In some religions, a devil is a bad spirit that tries to create problems for people. Some people also use the words \"the Devil\" or \"Satan\" for the most powerful devil. The word \"devil\" comes from the Greek word \"diabolos\" which means \"someone who tells lies to hurt you\". (\"Diabolos\" is translated to the English word \"slanderer.\") The Christian New Testament uses \"diabolos\" as a title for Satan, and so \"The Devil\" became another name for Satan in English. In the Old Testament, there is the serpent and the shaitan, who may be two different characters. \"Shaitan\" in Hebrew means \"adversary\" - an enemy or opponent.",
   "Poetry": "Poetry is a type of art form and a type of literature. Poetry uses the qualities of words, in different ways, to be artistic. (Poetry can be as short, as a few words, or as long as a book (an epic)). There are many \"poetic forms\" (forms of poetry). Some of them are: Sonnet, Haiku, Ballad, Stev, Ode, Free verse, Blank verse, thematic, and nursery rhymes. Poetry can be used to describe(comparing, talking about, or expressing emotion) many things. It can make sense or be nonsense, it can rhyme or not. It can have many shapes and sizes; it can be serious, or it can be funny. \"To say something poetically\" means to give information in an artistic way.",
   "Leisure": "Leisure (or free time) is when a person can choose what to do. During a person's leisure time, they do not have an obligation to be at school or work at a job. During leisure time, people can do fun activities, family activities, or other non-work activity, such as hobbies. A vacation or holiday is the setting aside of time specifically for leisure. During their vacation, some people travel to a different region or country, and stay at a hotel so that they can do things they could not do near home. Other people prefer to spend their vacation time at home in their own community. In wealthy industrialized countries such as the US, Canada, and Britain, workers are allowed to stay home on the weekend (usually Saturday and Sunday), and use it as leisure time. People in poorer developing countries usually have less leisure time, as they have to work longer hours and more days per year.",
   "Philosophy": "A philosophy is a way of thinking about the world, the universe, and about people. A philosophy is a group of ideas, worked out by a philosopher (someone who has studied ways of thinking about the world). The ideas in philosophy are \"abstract\", which means that they are \"things that cannot be touched.\" But this does not mean that philosophy is not about the real world. Ethics, for example, asks what we should do in our everyday lives, and metaphysics asks about how the world works and what it is made of. Sometimes people talk about how they have a \"personal philosophy\", which means the way a person thinks about the world. This article is \"not\" about people's \"personal philosophies.\" This article is about the ideas that have been thought about by philosophers (people who think and write about ways of thinking) for a long time. These ideas and questions from philosophy, and many more, have formed a large body of questions and knowledge that are written down in books. There are many different types of philosophy from different times and places. Some philosophers come from Ancient Greece, such as Plato and Aristotle. Others come from Asia, such as Confucius or Buddha. Some philosophers are from the Middle Ages in Europe, such as Scotus Erigena or Saint Thomas Aquinas. Philosophers from the 1600s, 1700s, and 1800s included Thomas Hobbes, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, John Locke, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant. Philosophers from the 1900s included Ludwig Wittgenstein and Jean-Paul Sartre. Where did the word come from? The word \"philosophy\" comes from two Greek words which mean 'love of wisdom'. Introduction. Philosophy is the study of humans and the world by thinking and asking questions. It is not part of science, because it is not an observation of things in the real world to find out how they work. Philosophy tries to answer important questions by coming up with answers about real things and asking \"why?\" Sometimes, philosophy tries to answer the same questions as religion and science. Philosophers do not all come up with the same answers to questions. Some people think there are no right answers in philosophy, only better answers and worse answers. Philosophy is a way of thinking in the \"middle-ground\" that is between science and religion. Many types of philosophy criticize or even attack the beliefs of science and religion. Categories in philosophy. Metaphysics is sometimes split up into ontology (the philosophy of real life and living things), the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of religion; but these sub-branches are very close together. Is philosophy good or bad? Does philosophy do any good? Very few people would dispute this. It is easy to argue that philosophy is a good thing, because it helps people to think more clearly. Philosophy helps people to understand the world and the way people act and think. Philosophers believe that asking philosophical questions is useful because it brings wisdom and helps people to learn about the world and each other. However, some people think that philosophy is harmful, as philosophy encourages free-thinking and often questions the beliefs that others hold. Philosophies such as some existentialist views say that there is no meaning to life or human existence, except the meaning that we make up or invent. People from some religions do not agree with the beliefs of existentialism. It should be noted that every major science, including physics, biology, and chemistry are all disciplines that originally were considered philosophy. As speculation and analysis about nature became more developed, these subjects branched away. This is a process that continues even today. Psychology only split in the past century. In our own time, subjects such as consciousness studies, decision theory, and applied ethics have increasingly found independence from philosophy as a whole. Because of this, philosophy seems useful because it makes new kinds of science. What philosophers do. Philosophers ask questions about ideas. They try to find answers to those questions. Some thinkers find it very hard to find those words that best describe the ideas they have. When they find answers to some of these questions philiosophers often have the same problem, that is how to best tell the answers they found to other people. Depending on the meaning of the words they use, the answers change. Some philosophers are full-time thinkers (called academics), who work for universities or colleges. These philosophers write books and articles about philosophy and teach classes about philosophy to university or college students. Other philosophers are just \"hobby\" thinkers who think about philosophy during their free time. A small number of hobby thinkers have thought so much about philosophy that they are able to write articles for philosophy magazines. Other people approach philosophy from another job. For example monks, artists, and scientists may think about philosophical ideas and questions. Most philosophers work by asking questions and looking for good definitions (meanings) of words to help them understand what a question means. Some philosophers say the only thing needed to answer a question is to find out what it means, and that the only thing that makes philosophical questions such as those above difficult is that people do not really know what they mean (for example Ludwig Wittgenstein). Philosophers will also often use both real and imaginary examples to make a point. For example, they may write about a real or fictional person in order to show what they think a good person or a bad person is like. Some philosophers look for the simplest way to answer a question and say that is probably the right answer. This is a process called Occam's razor. Others believe that complicated answers to questions can also be right. For an example of a philosophical problem, see the God paradox.",
   "Radio telescope": "A radio telescope is like a huge satellite dish. An ordinary telescope allows people to see light from distant objects. Stars shine and the light can be seen with a telescope, but they also give off radio waves. Scientists with radio telescopes receive these radio waves and use computers to learn about the stars. Other things like black holes also give off radio waves and radio telescopes are useful for learning about them too. The dish is sometimes constructed of a conductive wire mesh whose openings are smaller than a wavelength. The information received by several radio telescopes in different places can be combined. This gives similar results to having a single dish as big as the distance between the telescopes, so even very faint signals can be received. Scientists are also trying to do this with ordinary telescopes. The radio telescope at the Parkes Observatory, Parkes, New South Wales was used by NASA to receive messages from the Apollo 11 moon landings.",

   "Association football": "Association football is a sport played between two teams. Globally it is usually called football, but in some countries, such as the United States and Canada, it is called soccer. In Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, Australia and Republic of Ireland, both words are commonly used. In each team there are 11 players. 10 of them play on the field and one is the goalkeeper. The game is played by kicking a ball into the opponent's goal. A match has 90 minutes play, with a break of about 15 minutes in the middle. Competitions. There are many competitions for football, for both football clubs and countries. Football clubs usually play other teams in their own country, with a few exceptions. Cardiff City F.C. from Wales for example, play in the English leagues and in the English FA Cup. Groups such as UEFA and FIFA organise international competitions between clubs and countries. Clubs play in competitions such as UEFA Champions League or UEFA Cup, and countries play for the World Cup or a continental trophy such as the European Championship. The FIFA World Cup takes place every four years between national teams, and is the world's most popular sporting event, even more popular than the Olympic Games. In football, a championship is usually called a \"Cup\". For example, the FIFA World Cup or the FA Cup. Who plays football. Football is the world's most popular sport. It is played in more countries than any other game. In fact, FIFA (the Federation Internationale de Football Association) has more members than the United Nations. It is played by both males and females, but more commonly by males. In Europe, the main competitions to compete to be the best in Europe are the Champions League for the top teams from the top leagues in each country in Europe. Then there is the UEFA cup which is the next best teams from eaches of the top leagues competing. The most successful club in the world is Rangers F.C. from Scotland, having won more major titles than any other team in the world. They have won the country's league 51 times, a world record.",
   "First language": "A first language is the language that a person learned as a baby, normally from his or her parents. It is also known as a \"mother tongue\" or a \"native language\". Many people also learn another language - when they do this, it is called their \"second language\".",

It holds around 28,723 people. Their manager is Gary Megson. At home they play in a white shirt, navy blue shorts & white socks. Away they play in a mustard yellow shirt, teal green shorts and teal green socks.",
   "Armenia": "Armenia is a country in the Caucasus region of Europe. Its capital city is Yerevan. Armenia received its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Armenia touches Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Iran. There are some minorities living in Armenia, such as Greek, Russian, and other minorities, and more than 90% of the people are ethnic Armenians. Also, the Armenian Apostolic Church, is by far the largest religion in the country. There are a small amount of other Christians, Muslims and atheists. Armenia is the place that some Christians believe Noah's Ark landed, and Noah's family settled. The Armenian name for Armenia (Hayastan) means Land of Haik. Haik was the name of a great-great-grandson of Noah. Throughout history, Armenia's size has changed many times. Today Armenia is much smaller than it was once. In 80 BC, the Kingdom of Armenia covered parts of what is today Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Azerbaijan, and, of course, Armenia. From 1920 to 1991, Armenia was a Communist country. (Communism is a political idea.) It was a member of the Soviet Union. Today, Armenia's borders are locked with Turkey and Azerbaijan, due to conflicts. In 1992, Armenia and Azerbaijan had a war over the land of Nagorno-Karabakh. The fighting stopped in 1994, and Armenia has had control over this land, but Azerbaijan still disputes about the land.",
   "England": "England is the largest of four states that form United Kingdom. About 55 million people live in England. England is bordered by Wales and Scotland which are both also on the island of Great Britain. The capital city of England is London, which is also the largest city in England. Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester are also large cities in England. The English flag is white, with a red cross. This cross is the cross of Saint George, who is the patron saint of England. Some other symbols used for England are a red rose (for rugby) and three lions (for association football). Geography. England is on the island of Great Britain. Scotland is also part of Great Britain, joining the north of England, and Wales is to the west. To the east and south, and part of the west, England is bordered by sea. France is to the south, separated by the English Channel. The Channel Tunnel under the sea, links England and mainland Europe. Ireland is a large island to the west, divided into Northern Ireland which is part of the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland. Other countries of Europe that are near England are France and the Iceland. London is the largest city and the capital. Other large cities are Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol and Liverpool. The longest river in England is the Thames, (called the Tems) which runs through London. Other large rivers are the Severn, the Trent and the Humber. Language. The English language is a West Germanic language spoken in many countries around the world. With around 380 million native speakers, it is the third most spoken language in the world, as a native language. As many as a billion people speak it as a second language. English is an influence on, and has been influenced by many different languages. History. England was named after a German tribe called the \"Angles\", who settled in Central, Northern, and Eastern England in the 5th century. A related tribe called the \"Saxons\" settled in the south of England. That is why that period of English history is called \"Anglo-Saxon\". For the majority of this time, England did not exist as a united country. The Anglo Saxons lived in many small kingdoms, which slowly united. England became one country in 937. The first King of England was Athelstan, but he lost a lot of England to Danish invaders, who formed their own country in the East and North. Many villages and towns in this area (particularly in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire), still have Danish names, and use Danish-based words in their dialects. At one time Wessex (in the West of England) was the only English kingdom left. After many battles, King Alfred of Wessex became king of the whole of England, and the old kingdoms (Mercia, Northumberland, etc) just became provinces, called \"Earldoms\" governed by an \"Earl\". Soon after Alfred died, the king of Denmark (Knut or Canute) ruled England. England soon had an English king again. When King Edward (the Confessor) died, Harold (the Earl of Wessex) became king. William the Conqueror, Duke of Normandy, said that Harold had promised to make William the king, so he invaded England and fought King Harold at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. William won, and then became king of England. The kings of England spoke French for the next 300 years (The present ruler, Queen Elizabeth II is a descendant of William, but not very directly). England took over the country of Wales in the 13th century. There were many wars, often against France and Scotland. The religion of England was Roman Catholicism. The bishops (church leaders) of England and all their churches looked to the pope and the church in Rome, Italy, for leadership. Many of the bishops did not agree with this. During the reign of King Henry VIII in the 1500s, the bishops made an agreement with Henry to give him a divorce, if he would break with the Church of Rome. The Church of England (a \"Protestant\" church) became the official church in England at this time. For the next 200 years, there were difficulties over whether the ruler was \"Roman Catholic\" or \"Protestant\". Queen Elizabeth I was Henry's second daughter. She was a powerful queen who ruled for more than 40 years. When Queen Elizabeth I died, she had no children, and in 1603 James VI of Scotland (the son of Mary, Queen of Scots) became King James I of England. He called his two countries \"Great Britain\", but they were still separate countries with their own parliaments and laws, even though they had the same King. James' son, Charles I and the English Parliament fought each other in the English Civil War (Scotland and Ireland were involved as well, but the story is complicated!). Oliver Cromwell became leader of the Parliamentary Army (the \"Roundheads\") and defeated the Royalist Army (the \"Cavaliers\"). King Charles was beheaded in 1649 and Oliver Cromwell became dictator (\"Lord Protector\"). When Cromwell died, his son Richard was not strong enough to rule, and King Charles II, the son of Charles I, was invited to come to England and be king in 1660. When King Charles II died, his brother James II was the next king. James was unpopular with a lot of people because he was Roman Catholic. England was invaded by William of Orange (ruler of part of the Netherlands and husband of Mary, the daughter of King James). Many people welcomed William because he was a Protestant. James left the country without a fight and Parliament asked William and Mary to become King and Queen together. When Mary died, William ruled alone. Queen Mary's sister, Anne, became the next queen. While she was queen, England and Scotland were officially joined as one country, in 1707, and lost their separate parliaments. The parliament in London now included Scottish \"MPs\", and was called the British parliament. After this, the history of England becomes the history of Great Britain and United Kingdom. The United Kingdom was formed in 1800, when Irish Parliament merged with British one. (Northern Ireland is now the only part of Ireland still in the UK.) England is the only state of UK not to have its own government, Parliament or Assembly, but to be Governed by Parliament of the United Kingdom. English culture. See English literature. Sport. The English football team has won the World Cup. They came close in Italia 1990, narrowly losing to West Germany on penalties. In the 2006 World Cup they reached the quarter finals, then lost to Portugal after penalty kicks.",

It is the only language to do that. The homonym capitalize is a different word, and means \"to fully fund as an investment\".",
   "Force (physics)": "In physics, force is what changes or tends to change a state of rest or motion in an object. Force causes objects to accelerate, add to the object's overall pressure, or change direction. Force is measured in Newtons (N). where formula_2 is the force, formula_3 is the mass of an object, and formula_4 is the acceleration of the object. where formula_7 is the weight of an object, formula_3 is the mass of an object, and formula_9 is the acceleration due to gravity at sea level. It is about formula_10. Force is a vector, so it has both a magnitude and a direction.",
   "Scientific method": "Science and things that are not science (such as pseudoscience) is often defined by whether they use the scientific method. Not all scientists use the above \"scientific method\" in their day to day work. Sometimes the actual work of science looks nothing like the above. But on the whole it is thought to be a good method for finding out things about the world which are reliable, and is the model for thinking about scientific knowledge usually used by scientists. __notoc__ Example: Dissolving sugar in water. Let's say we are going to do an experiment to find out what things might change how sugar dissolves in a glass of water. Below is one way to do this, following the scientific method step by step. Aim. Does sugar dissolve faster in hot water or cold water? Does the temperature affect how fast the sugar dissolves? This is a question we might want to ask. Creating a hypothesis. Now that we have the question, we need to come up with a hypothesis which can be tested. One hypothesis might be: \"Sugar will dissolve faster in hot water than cold water.\" (It could be the opposite just as well.) This can be tested: either sugar will dissolve faster in hot water than cold water, and prove our hypothesis correct, or it may dissolve faster in cold water, or it may dissolve at the same speed in both, proving our hypothesis wrong. In any case we will know part of the answer to our first questions. Planning the experiment. One simple way to create an experiment would be to dissolve sugar in water of different temperatures and to keep track of how much time it takes for the sugar to dissolve. We will want to make sure that we use the exact same amount of water in each trial, and the exact same amount of sugar. If we did not have the same number of either, we might influence the experiment in a way that would make it impossible to tell if the change in temperature was what was changing the speed of dissolving. To be extra careful, we would also run the experiment in a way that the water temperature does not change during the experiment. This is called \"isolating one variable\" \u2014 which means making sure that only one thing is being changed each time. Running the experiment. We will do the experiment in three trials, which are exactly the same, except for the temperature of the water. Drawing conclusions. If every other part of the experiment was the same (we did not use more sugar one time than the other, we did not stir one time or the other, etc.), then this would be very good evidence that heat affects how fast sugar is dissolved. We cannot know for sure, though, that there is not something else affecting it. An example of a \"hidden cause\" might be that sugar dissolves faster each time more sugar is dissolved into the same pot. This is probably not true, but if it were, it could make the results exactly the same: three trials, and the last one would be fastest. We have no reason to think that this is true at this time, but we might want to note it as another possible answer. If we wanted to, we might create a new experiment, where we would try to dissolve sugar in the same pot three different times at the same temperature. By not changing the temperature, we would know if it was the pot which was causing the change in dissolving, if there was any change at all. But this would be a different experiment. This example is just meant to show how the results of one scientific experiment can lead to another brand-new experiment. Writing up the results. When writing up the results we would describe exactly what we did, from the first step, including: why we asked the question; what we assumed when asking it; what our hypothesis was; what our experiments were; how we ran the experiments; what the results were (our data table would make them easy for others to read); and what our conclusions were. In the end, our hypothesis seems to be correct. After writing up our conclusions, we would, if we were professional scientists, send them to other scientists to look at, to see if it sounded right to them. Maybe they would have suggestions, or get ideas for new experiments. If we were professional scientists, we would probably have the results published in a research journal, where other scientists would have a chance to agree or disagree. It doesn't matter if other scientists find us out to be wrong later, because this is how knowledge grows in science.",
   "Abrahamic religion": "People use the term Abrahamic Religion for a number of religions that recognise Abraham as an important person. The best known and probably most popular Abrahamic religions are Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Another Abrahamic religion is the gnostic movement called Mandaeism. Mandaeism originated in the 2nd or 3rd century in moden-day Iraq and Iran, probably from a movement with Christian backgrounds. Other movements are Bahai and Rastafarianism. The Bahai faith originated in the 19th century and Rastafarianism in the early 20th century. Even though these religions are quite different from each other in many ways, they also agree in many other very important ways on the basic general nature of the one God whom they worship. The word \"Abrahamic\" refers to the ancient prophet Abraham, who is respected in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as the first prophet of God. Another thing Abrahamic religions have in common is that they are \"Monotheistic\" (from the Greek words for \"one\" and \"God\"), meaning belief in just one God. They also all believe that people should pray to this God often.",
   "Time Cube": "Time Cube is a website created by Gene Ray. On that website, Dr. Ray explains his \"Time Cube\" theory, which describes the planet Earth as having a cubic symmetry, and time as rotating four \"corners\". Many scientists reject these ideas, saying that they make no sense and cannot be tested. The Time Cube website is written in an angry and hateful voice. On his site, Ray says that anyone who does not believe in Time Cube is \"stupid and evil\". Some of the comments are racist, especially against black people and Jews. There are also many comments against gay people. Many people find the site to be difficult to understand. Ray has spoken about Time Cube at two universities in the United States, MIT and Georgia Tech. At MIT, a dean tried to cancel the lecture before it had taken place. Ray sees this as proof of a conspiracy to keep information about Time Cube hidden.",

   "European Union": "The European Union (abbreviation: EU) is an economic and political union of 27 member countries in Europe, started in 1957 as the European Economic Community (EEC). It has created a common economic area with Europe-wide laws allowing people to move and trade in other EU countries almost like it was their own. Fifteen of these countries also share the same money: the euro. On January 1st 2009, Slovakia will have the Euro as well. History. After World War II the countries in Europe wanted to live peacefully together and help one another's economies. Instead of fighting for coal and steel, the first member countries (West) Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg created one European Coal and Steel Community in 1952. In 1957 in the Italian city of Rome, the member countries signed another treaty and made the European Economic Community. Now it was a community for coal, steel and for trade. Later it changed the name to European Community. In 1992, with the \"Treaty of Maastricht\" it changed its name to the European Union. Now the member countries work together not only in politics and economy (coal, steel and trade), but also in money, justice (laws), and foreign affairs. With the Schengen Agreement, 13 member countries of the EU opened their borders to each other, so people can now travel from one country to the other without a passport or identity card. Now already 15 member countries have replaced their national currencies with the euro.10 new countries became members of the EU in 2004 and 2 more became members of the EU in 2007. Today there are 27 member countries altogether. Free movement. A person who has a passport of a European Union country can live and work in any of the other 27 member countries without needing a work permit or visa. For example, a British person can move to Greece to work there, or just to live there, and he or she does not need a permission from an authority in Greece. In the same way, products made in one member country can be sold in any other member country without any special permissions or extra taxes. For this reason, the members agree rules on product safety - they want to know that a product made in another country will be as safe as it would be if it had been made in their own country. Main institutions. The Union has three political institutions with the executive and legislative power. The Council represents governments, the Parliament represents citizens and the Commission represents the European interest. The Council, Parliament or another party can request legislation from the Commission. The Commission then drafts this and presents it to the Parliament and Council. In most cases both must agree. After it is approved and signed by both chambers it becomes law. The Commission's duty is to ensure it is implemented by dealing with the day-to-day running of the Union. Council of the European Union. This is the main decision-making institution. The cabinet ministers of the member countries meet (Ministers for Foreign affairs, for Agriculture, for Justice, etc...) and discuss their relevant issues. Each member state takes a turn at being President of the Council for six months. For example: from January 2007 until July 2007, Germany holds the presidency. The six months before, Finland held the presidency. The President of the Council is the organiser and manager, he or she does not have the power to make decisions about the European Union like the President of the United States does. Member countries with a large population (Germany, France, United Kingdom etc.) have more votes than countries with small populations (Luxembourg, Malta, etc.) but a decision cannot be made if there the vote against is big enough. Twice a year, the heads of government (Prime Ministers) and/or the heads of state (Presidents) meet to discuss the main issues and make decisions on different matters, this meeting is different and not as formalised, it is known as a European Council. European Commission. The European Commission manages the day to day running of the EU and writes laws, like a government. Laws written by the Commission are discussed and changed by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The Commission has one President and 26 Commissioners, selected by the European Council. The Commission President is appointed by the European Council with the approval of the European Parliament. The Commission operates like a cabinet government. There is one Commissioner per member state, though Commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state. European Parliament. The Parliament has a total of 785 members (called Members of the European Parliament, or MEP). They are elected in their countries every five years by the citizens of the European Union member countries. The Parliament can approve, reject or change proposed laws. It can also sack the European Commission. In that case, the entire commission would have to give up their jobs. Member countries. In 1951, six countries made the \"European Coal and Steel Community\", a basic version of what the EU is now. These six then went further and in 1957 they made the European Economic Community and the European Coal and Steel Community. The UK and others decided not to join, and then when the UK changed its mind it was stopped from joining by French President Charles de Gaulle. When he was no longer President, the UK and others started to join. Today there are 27 members but the idea that more should join is not seen as a good one by everyone. Croatia, Republic of Macedonia and Turkey are \"candidate countries\", they are being considered for membership. Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia (including or along side Kosovo) are expected to follow. Politics. There are many discussions in the EU about how it should develop and change in the future.",
   "Pronoun": "A pronoun is traditionally called a part of speech in grammar (but many modern linguists, experts in linguistics, call it a special type of noun) In English, pronouns are words such as \"me, she, his, them, herself, each other, it, what\". Pronouns are often used to take the place of a noun, when that noun is understood (has already been named), to avoid repeating it. For example, instead of saying When a pronoun replaces a noun, the noun is called the antecedent. But, there are times when the pronoun has no antecedent. This is because generally, the antecedent (what comes before) refers grammatically to the use of the relative pronoun in particular. For example, in the sentence: \"The dog that was walking down the street\", the relative pronoun is the word that referring back to the antecedent, the word 'dog'. In the sentence \"The spy who loved me\", the relative pronoun is the word 'who' and its antecedent is the word 'spy'. Differences and similarities to nouns. Pronouns are different from common nouns because they normally can't come after \"article\"s or other \"determiner\"s. (For example, people don't say \"the it\".) Pronouns also rarely come after adjectives. They are also different because many of them change depending on how they are used. For example, \"we\" is a 'subject' in grammar, but the word changes to \"us\" when used as an object. Pronouns are the same as nouns because they both change for number (singular & plural), case (subject, object, possessive, etc.), and gender (male, female, animate, inanimate, etc.) Nouns and pronouns can be used in almost all the same places in sentences, and they name the same kinds of things: people, objects, etc. Even though they can't normally come after determiners, or adjectives, neither can proper nouns. Kinds of pronouns. There are four kinds of pronouns: personal, reciprocal, interrogative, and relative. Personal pronouns in English. This table shows all the personal pronouns in English that are commonly used today. A Subject Pronoun can replace a noun that is the subject of a sentence. Refer to the table above; the subject pronouns are: I, You, He, She, It, We, They. Another type of personal pronoun is called the 'reflexive pronoun'. Reflexive pronouns are the words ending in '-self' or '-selves', such as: \"myself, itself, themselves\".",
   "Indonesia": "Indonesia is a country in Southeast Asia. It is part of the Malay Archipelago. It has 18,108 islands. 6,000 of these islands are inhabited. The most important islands of Indonesia are Java, Bali, Borneo, Sulawesi, and Sumatra. The capital of Indonesia is Jakarta, on Java. The current president is Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. Modern Indonesia began on the 17th of August 1945. At 10 o'clock on that Friday morning, Ir. Soekarno read Indonesia's Declaration of Independence. Indonesia Independence Day is a national holiday. Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world with a population of 238,452,952 (2004 est.) There are 111 inhabitants per km\u00b2. The official language of Indonesia is Bahasa Indonesia, but a total of 737 languages are spoken throughout Indonesia mostly confined to remote tribal groups. Other languages widely spoken in Indonesia include Javanese, Balinese and Sundanese. The closest countries are Papua New Guinea, Malaysia, and East Timor which share land borders with Indonesia. Other neighbouring countries are Australia to the south, Singapore to the north-west, and Phillipines to the north-east. The religion that most people follow is Islam. Other religions include Christianity (Protestant, and Roman Catholic), Hinduism, and Buddhism. Pre World War II. Indonesia has written history dating to the 7th century. Before the colonial Dutch came in the 1700s, Indonesia consisted of many kingdoms in perpetual warfare. Indonesia was ruled by the Netherlands from the 17th century until World War II. Modern Indonesia. During World War II, the Japanese drove out the Dutch and took charge of Indonesia. After the Japanese surrender, Indonesia claimed its independence on the 17th of August 1945. The proclamation was read by Ir. Soekarno in Jakarta. Soekarno later became Indonesia's first President. British troops came into Indonesia to restore peace and to rescue Europeans who had been prisoners of the Japanese. The British troops also had the job of shipping home 300,000 Japanese troops. The Indonesian Republicans fought the British troops, because it was expected that the British would give Indonesia back to the Dutch. The Indonesian Republicans killed many of the Japanese prisoners, before they could be sent home. They also began killing people from minority groups who might be against the new Republic. Many European and Indonesian European people were killed. Many Chinese business people and other minority groups were killed or made homeless. In Java there were many thousands of homeless people. In 1946, the Dutch came back. When the British left in 1947, there were 55,000 Dutch soldiers in Indonesia. The Dutch action was called \"Operatie Product\" or \"Politionele Acties\". The Indonesian Republicans fought the Dutch until 1949. But the Indonesian Republicans were badly organised and often fought among themselves. As the Dutch forced the Republican soldiers out of different areas, they moved in more troops until there was 100,000 Dutch troops. The Dutch refused to obey the United Nations who said they should stop the fighting in Indonesia. The United States of America organised for meetings between Dutch and Indonesian leaders. The Dutch finally agreed to recognise Indonesia's independence in November 1949. Because of the fighting and the bad organistion, it took a long time for the country to become peaceful, and for the economy to get better. Many Indonesian soldiers had died, between 45,000 and 100,000. Also, a very large number of civilian (people not in the army), Indonesians, Europeans and Chinese, had died; perhaps as many as 200,000. Indonesian people and culture. There are people of many different cultural groups living in Indonesia.",

The island of Taiwan is claimed as a \"province\" by the People's Republic of China (PRC), but it not under their control, Taiwan is currently a democratic island known officially as the Republic of China (Taiwan).",
   "Creator": "A Creator is a person who creates something. In some religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) God (or Allah meaning the God in Arabic) is the most important and original Creator of the whole Universe - including Man who is made \"in his image\"(see Genesis) to observe it and control it like God. The idea that anything that a person is creating, like an idea, can be owned as property comes from the ethical traditions and legal codes that came from these religions. In other traditions (Buddhism, Native American religions) anyone has this potential for creating, and can become part of the greater creating of the universe. Stewardship of home, land and all of Earth is a test for participating in this, or just good sense. Sometimes this belief is not well understood, and poorly translated (such as the verb in Native American languages meaning \"the greatest creating\" being translated into English as Creator) by those who only understand the \"Man in God's image\" view. This view has often been projected onto people who do not believe in it, along with concepts of intellectual rights inappropriate for those peoples.",
   "Beryllium": "Beryllium is an alkaline earth metal. It is grayish (slightly gray) in color. It has an atomic number of 4 and is symbolized by the letters Be. It is toxic and should not be handled by anyone without proper training. Beryllium's atomic structure consists of 4 electrons, 4 protons, and 5 neutrons. Beryllium is most likely known for the chemical compounds it forms. Some of these are emeralds and aquamarines. Beryllium has one of the highest melting points of the light metals. At standard temperature and pressures beryllium resists oxidation when exposed to oxygen.",
   "Eye": "The eye is the part of the body that lets humans and most animals see. It also gives them knowledge of nature's 24-hour cycle of light and darkness. Most animals have two eyes. The eye is an organ for the purpose of sensing light. The simplest eyes (such as those of some animals and even protein spots in one-celled organisms) register nothing but whether the surrounding area is light or darkness. Some snails, for example, see no image (picture) at all, but they \"see\" light, enabling them to keep out of direct sunlight. Slightly better eyes are shaped like cups, which lets the organism know from which direction light is coming. More complex eyes give the full sense of vision, including color, motion, and texture. These eyes have a round shape that makes light rays focus on the back part of the eye, called the \"retina\". There are (at least) three types of light-sensitive cells in the retina in mammals. Two of them, \"rods\" and \"cones\", allow sight (or seeing) by sending signals through the optic nerve to the brain. The third type senses light for a different purpose than seeing. Some special \"ganglion\" cells in the retina send their information about light to the brain along a different path (the \"retinohypothalamic tract\"). This information adjusts (synchronizes) the individual's circadian rhythm to nature's light/dark cycle of 24 hours. This system also works for some blind people who cannot see light at all. Some animals can see light which is outside of the human range of visible light. They can see ultraviolet or infrared light. The \"lens\" on the front part of the eye is curved and acts like a camera lens. It can be pulled flatter or rounder by muscles inside the eye. As some people get older, they might not be as able to do this. Many people are born with other sight problems or get them later in life, and they may need eyeglasses (or \"contact lenses\") to fix the problem.",

The home stadium of the club is Portman Road in Ipswich, England. This stadium can hold 30,300 people. Ipswich Town plays in the Football League Championship. This division used to be called English Division One. Local fans call the team 'town' because it is a shortened version of the team name. They are also called 'blues' because Ipswich plays in a mostly blue uniform. Some people also call Ipswich the 'tractor boys'. This nickname was mainly created by newspapers. Many Ipswich fans use this name as a joke rather than letting it be an insult. The main rival of Ipswich Town is Norwich City. When these two teams play, there are very few empty seats and the crowd is usually louder than any other game. Ipswich Town finished the 2005-6 season of The Championship play in 15th place. Championships. Ipswich Town has won the top division once when it was called Division one, it is now called the Premier League. They have won the FA Cup once.

   "United States dollar": "The United States dollar, or the American dollar, is the official currency, or money, of the United States of America. When writing, the symbol for the American dollar is the dollar sign ($). Dollars can also be known as USD (U.S. Dollar). The American one dollar bill has a picture of George Washington. There are also paper bills that are worth 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 dollars. There are also dollar coins. Some of them are silver and some of them are gold-colored. Vending machines often give dollar coins as change, since it is easier for the machines to give out coins than paper money. But most of the time people use paper dollars. There are 100 cents in one American dollar. The cent or \"penny\" is the smallest or least worth coin used in the U.S. There are half-dollar coins, which are worth 50 cents. Quarters are worth 25 cents, dimes are worth ten cents, nickels are worth five cents, and pennies are worth one cent. All coins and paper bills have the faces of famous Americans on the front side. The paper \"dollar bill\" is actually called a \"Federal Reserve Note\". \"Federal\" refers to the U.S. government. The United States Constitution (the main laws in the country), first said that the government must hold enough gold to redeem (trade for) the paper money it printed. This means that, if needed, paper money could be traded to the government for gold. The government of the United States stopped using this \"gold standard\" in 1971, which means it no longer needs to have enough gold to trade for paper money. The Federal Reserve is the federal government's bank. It lets other banks borrow money. The banks then let people and companies take the money from them. The banks then pay money at a rate called the Federal Funds Rate. This number is set by the Federal Reserve Board and is changed however money is in the country. The paid rate is called the \"overnight lending rate\" because money is borrowed for a small time. By giving to banks,(or creating liquidity)the \"Fed\" can bring more money into the world and focus interest on newly created money. Many dollars never enter into the cycle which makes money. They are held in digital accounts and never live in paper form. After printing by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, the real paper dollars are sold for no more than the cost of the ink and paper.",
   "Statistics": "Statistics is a way to collect and analyze measurements. Statistics is used to describe data and to test theories about the world and how it works. Statistics is based on probability \u2014 the \"laws of chance\". Collecting data. Before the world can be described with statistics, data has to be collected. This data has the form of measurements. After the data is collected, there will be a series of numbers which describe that observation, or measurement. A typical example might be to find out how popular a certain TV program is, how many people watch it. Another example might be to find out, whether a certain drug helps in curing a specific disease. Methods. Most commonly statistical data is by doing surveys, or experiments. Surveys are done by using a small number individuals, and collecting data from them. They may be asked questions, if there are people. If they are not, some measurements might be taken from them. The choice of which individuals to take for a survey or data collection is very important, as it directly influences the statistics. When the statistics are done, it can no longer be determined which individuals are taken. Suppose, the water quality of a lake needs to be measured. It is a big lake. If samples are taken next to the waste drain, results of this will be totally different, than if the samples are taken in a remote, nearly inaccessible spot of the lake, Errors. We can avoid chance errors by taking a larger sample, and we can avoid some bias by choosing randomly. However, sometimes large random samples are hard to take. And bias can happen if some people refuse to answer our questions, or if they know they are getting a fake treatment. These problems can be hard to fix. Finding the middle of the data. The middle of the data is often called an average. The average tells us about a typical individual in the population. There are three kinds of average that are often used: the mean, the median and the mode. Name | A B C D E F G H I J score| 23 26 49 49 57 64 66 78 82 92 Mean. The formula for the mean is formula_1 Where formula_2 are the data and formula_3 is the population size. (see Sigma Notation). In our example formula_4 The problem with the mean is that it does no longer tell about how the values are distributed. It is easy to influence the mean by extreme values. In statistics, extreme values might be errors of measurement, Median. The median is the middle item of the data. To find the median we sort the data from the smallest number to the largest number and then choose the number in the middle. If there are an even number of data we choose the two middle ones and calculate their mean. In our example there are 10 items of data, the two middle ones are \"E\" and \"F\", so the median is (57+64)/2 = 60.5. Mode. The mode is the most frequent item of data. For example the most common letter in English is the letter \"e\". We would say that \"e\" is the mode of the distribution of the letters. Other descriptive statistics. We use it to find out that some percent, percentile, number, or fraction of people or things in a group do something or fit in a certain category. For example, social scientists used statistics to find out that 49% of people in the world are males. \"See also: Normal distribution\"",
   "United Kingdom": "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, usually shortened to the United Kingdom or UK, is a sovereign state in northwest Europe. It is made up of four countries, what used to be the two kingdoms of England and Scotland, the principality of Wales (all three on the island of Great Britain), and the province of Northern Ireland (on the island of Ireland). About 60 million people live in the UK. Most people in the UK speak English. There are several other native languages, other than English. They are Welsh in Wales, Cornish in Cornwall, Scottish (Gaelic) and Scots in Scotland, Irish in Northern Ireland, French in the Channel Islands and Angloromani. About 270 other languages are spoken. Major languages spoken in the United Kingdom other than English include Eastern Panjabi or Punjabi (471,000 - approximate number of speakers in the UK), Bengali (400,000), Urdu (400,000), Yue Chinese, mainly Cantonese (300,000), Greek (200,000), Southwestern Caribbean Creole English (170,000). The national anthem is called God Save the Queen History. Wales was taken over by England in the 13th century. In 1603, when Queen Elizabeth I of England died, her closest relative was King James VI of Scotland. He became king of England as well as king of Scotland, but the two countries stayed separate. In 1707, the Scottish and English Parliaments agreed the Treaty of Union, which joined the two countries into one country called \"The Kingdom of Great Britain\". By the year 1800, England had already had much influence over Ireland for over 600 years. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain and Ireland to merge the two states. This was against the wishes of many of the Irish people, as they had in previous centuries already suffered much English oppression. The new country was called the \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\". In 1922 much of Ireland became independent as the Irish Free State (now called the Republic of Ireland) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties of Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed \"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\". Tony Blair was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2007. The Conservative party ruled for 18 years before his Labour party won elections. The current Prime Minister is Gordon Brown. Geography. The capital city of the United Kingdom is London, a large city on the River Thames in south-eastern England. Other large cities in the UK are Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle upon Tyne, Leeds, Sheffield, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Belfast, Southampton, Leicester, Coventry, Bradford and Nottingham. The UK is north-west off the coast of mainland Europe. Around the UK are the North Sea, the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean. The UK is also in charge of a few smaller places around the world, most of them are islands, which are known as \"overseas territories\". The weather of the United Kingdom is warm summers, cool winters and lots of rain throughout the year. The reasons include its northerly latitude and the warm water from the Atlantic Ocean's Gulf Stream. Politics. The UK is a constitutional monarchy and a Hereditary monarchy. The people of the United Kingdom vote for a Member of Parliament to speak for them and to help make laws for them. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the queen of the UK and is the head of state (person in charge of the country). Even though she is the head of state, she does not choose what the United Kingdom should do about things like education, healthcare or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in the United Kingdom is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime Minister is Gordon Brown, who is the leader of the Labour party. Parliament, where laws are made, has three constituent parts: the House of Commons and the House of Lords and the Queen in Parliament. The House of Commons generally holds primacy. The Members of Parliament serve in the Commons, as has every Prime Minister since the Marquess of Salisbury resigned in 1902. The peers sitting in the House of Lords are not chosen by all of the people of the United Kingdom. They are people who are peers, because their parents were peers (ie. they are hereditary peers), they have been created peers or they are important officials in the established Church of England. The 92 hereditary peers are the only elected members of the House of Lords. There are two other hereditary peers in the House of Lords because they also have jobs to do on state occasions Scotland has its own devolved Parliament with power to make laws on things like education, health and scots law. Northern Ireland and Wales have their own devolved Assemblies which have some powers but less than the Scottish parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign and it could end the devolved administrations at any time. Economy. The UK is a developed country with sixth largest economy in the world. It was a major world power during the 19th and early 20th century. The economic cost of two world wars and the decline of the British Empire in the latter 20th century reduced its leading role in global affairs. The UK retains strong economic, cultural, military and political influence and is a nuclear power. It is a member state of the European Union. The UK holds a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, and is a member of the G8, NATO, World Trade Organization and the Commonwealth of Nations. Literature. William Shakespeare is perhaps the most famous English playwright. He wrote plays in the late 16th century including \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Macbeth\". In the 19th century, Jane Austen and Charles Dickens were popular novelists. Twentieth century writers include the science fiction novelist H. G. Wells and J. R. R. Tolkien. The children's fantasy \"Harry Potter\" series is written by J. K. Rowling. Arthur Conan Doyle from Scotland wrote the Sherlock Holmes detective novels. He was from Edinburgh. The poet Dylan Thomas has brought Welsh culture to international attention. Education. England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have separate systems of education. They have in common that education is required from ages five to sixteen. The majority of children attend state schools but a small proportion of children attend private schools. United Kingdom has the leading universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Durham University, Chatham and St Andrews.",
   "As": "In other words, you can say more generally what an idiom or metaphor says: for example, \"battle of the sexes\" is both a metaphor and an idiom that suggests \"love as war\". Because of this power, you can restate an idiom or metaphor in a way that makes it clear what it means, and what it might assume.",
   "Photosynthesis": "Photosynthesis is a process used by plants, some protists, and some bacteria to make food. It makes glucose (a kind of sugar) and oxygen from carbon dioxide in the air and water. Cells (very small parts that make up a plant or animal) use it to create energy to live. Summary of the process. Photosynthesis starts when light touches a green part of a plant. Each green cell has small parts called chloroplasts inside of them. Single photons of light hit green chemicals in the chloroplast, causing an enzyme to break apart water. Water, when broken, makes oxygen, hydrogen, and energy. The energy is used by a protein that lets light into the cell. The light cannot get out of the cell until another protein lets them, and this protein uses the energy from the escaping light to make ATP. While this is happening, the hydrogen and oxygen join broken up carbon dioxide to form glucose. This glucose is later used in cellular respiration to form more ATP. Without Photosynthesis, much of the world wouldn't be alive. Everyone and everything needs the oxygen produced by photosynthesis to live. Plants, some Bacteria and Protists make food through Photosynthesis, this is where plants turn Carbon Dioxide and Water into Glucose \u2013 Sugar of sorts \u2013 using the energy in Sunlight, Oxygen is a waste product.",
   "Open content": "Open Content is when someone creates something and allows others to copy it or make changes without having to ask for permission. Any media can be open content, from text and pictures to video and sound. When someone creates something (like a picture or book), they can choose to make that work \"open\". This means that other people are allowed to copy it and change it if they want. Something that is open content may be free of charge, but it does not have to be. The Simple English Wikipedia is open content. So are other Wikipedias. If a person changes open content or makes new open content, everyone can give it to anyone else, or even sell it. It is never needed to ask permission to do this, because the people who wrote the text already gave their permission when they clicked the Save button. License. The rules that say how people can use, change and pass around open content are called a license. A license explains exactly what you are allowed to do with the content that falls under it. Licenses are often written in difficult lawyer language (\"legalese\"), but many licenses have summaries that are much easier to understand. The makers of open content get to choose what license to use for their work, and everyone else has to follow it. Only the maker, who owns the copyright, can change it to another license. Most open content licenses say that when others change the work, they must also declare it to be open and under the same license. This is called \"share-alike\" and means that anything based on work will always be open content. All the content in Wikipedia is open under the rules of the GNU Free Documentation License, a very well-known open content license. Other well-known open content licenses are the Creative Commons licenses.",
   "Basket": "A basket is a container. It is usually light. People weave narrow pieces of material together to form baskets. Wood, grasses, or wicker are often used to make baskets. They are also made out of plastic today. In basketball, the basket is an open net fixed to a metal ring in which players try to throw the ball.",
   "Force": "The word force means \"to make someone or something do something\". For example, \"Soldiers came to the town and forced all the people there to leave.\" Scientists also use the word \"force\". In the science of physics, a force causes objects to accelerate (change the way they are moving). When equal forces act in opposite directions, they cancel each other out. Gravity is a force. It makes things move toward each other. On the Earth, we see that it makes things fall toward the ground.",
   "Experiment": "An experiment is a test of an idea invented by someone, usually a scientist. An experiment is used to test a theory--to see how well the real world matches the theory. Experiments have been used for many years to help people understand the world around them. One important observation about experiments is that they can tell us if a theory is false. They cannot tell us if a theory is true. For example, if we invent a theory that says \"All houses are made of wood\", we cannot say that it is true because all the houses we have seen are made of wood. But, if we find a house that \"is not\" made of wood, we know that our theory is false. Benjamin Franklin did a well known experiment by flying a kite during a thunderstorm. He did the experiment to see if lightning was made of electricity. Experiments are not the same as faith (belief) or other ways to find truth because experiments must have proof. They begin by testing falsehood to find out truth. \"The universe does not tell us when we are right, only when we are wrong.\" - Karl Popper",
   "BBC": "The BBC or the British Broadcasting Corporation is an organisation in the UK. It broadcasts in the United Kingdom and other countries on television, radio and the Internet. The BBC also sells its programs to other broadcasting companies in the world. The organisation is run by a group of twelve governors who have been given the job by the Queen, on the advice of government ministers. The governors appoint a Board of Management to take care of running the business of the BBC. The head of the Board of Management is called the Director General. BBC Charter. The BBC is established under a Royal Charter, which allows the BBC to broadcast. In 2006, the British Government looked at the charter to see if it needed changing. Another agreement, which goes with the Charter, recognizes that the BBC should be independent from any other organization. It also says what the BBC should do for the people in Britain (the public). Finance. Every household in the UK that owns a television must pay for a TV Licence. Because the BBC gets its money from TV licences, it does not take money from companies or shareholders, so it does not have to do what they want. Also, it is not allowed to broadcast commercials. The BBC makes extra money in several ways. One way is by selling its programs to other broadcasting companies. Another way is by selling audio tapes and CDs of its best radio programs, and videos and DVDs of its best television programs. Still another way is by selling books based on programs, and magazines about science and natural history. BBC television guide. The BBC also publishes a weekly magazine called \"Radio Times\". This used to print listings of all the week's BBC radio and television programs in the United Kingdom, but in the 1990s it began to print listings of programs broadcast by other companies in the United Kingdom as well. It also prints stories about programs and the people who make them and the people who appear in them. \"Radio Times\" is one of the best selling magazines in the United Kingdom. The BBC has to publish a report every year, which tells people what it has done and how much money it has made and spent.

The headquarters of the BBC is Broadcasting House in Portland Place, London. The BBC also has other offices such as the BBC Television Centre in White City, London, as well in other cities like Cardiff, Belfast, Glasgow, Birmingham, Manchester, Bristol, Southampton and Newcastle upon Tyne. Rather than hire local reporters everywhere, the BBC's journalists work in many countries across the world. This means BBC workers are sometimes in danger, especially in war zones. Most recently Alan Johnston was kidnapped and held hostage for many months in Gaza before being safety released. BBC iPlayer. Between October 2005 and 28 February 2006 the BBC offered a service called the BBC iPlayer on their website - bbc.co.uk. It allowed people to catch up on the last seven days of TV and radio on the BBC. Users could either watch (stream) it or download the content on their computers. The downloading option was only for Microsoft Windows computers. The iPlayer service was released to the public on 25 December 2007. The slogan for BBC iPlayer is: 'Making the Unmissable, Unmissable.'",

There has been human settlement in the area that is now Austria for a long time. The first settlers go back to the Paleolithic age, they time of the Neanderthals. They left works of art, such as the Venus of Willendorf. In the Neolithic age, people were living there to dig for resources, especially copper. \u00d6tzi, a mummy found in a glacier between Austria and Italy, is from that time. In the Bronze Age bigger settlements and fortresses were built, especially where there were resources. Salt mining began near Hallstatt. At that time, Celts began to form the first states. The Romans. The Romans settled in most of modern Austria. They built larger cities. The most important of these were Carnuntum (near Vienna), Virunum (north of Klagenfurt) and Teurnia (near Spittal an der Drau). Modern times. Austria was an empire from about 800 to 1918.

If someone has \"know-how\" it means that they can put \"knowledge\" to work in doing or building something. Origin. Knowledge comes from being in an environment, having some experience there, and then sharing what was learned - so that others do not have to be in that environment or have that experience to \"know\" what someone else knows. Type of knowledge. When doing science, it is necessary to set up a strict experiment so that the important elements of the environment and experience are repeatable and so that simple numbers or models can be shared afterward. Other types of knowledge. Other types of knowledge can be for a more specific purpose, for example learning a language. In business the field of knowledge sharing deals with the use of computers to record and share what employees know. KnowledgePoints.

This is an idiom meaning \"to use something simpler to get something more complex to make itself work better.\" The word \"boot\" is also used to describe how a computer starts up when a person presses the \"on\" button. Another term \"To boot\" is an idiom meaning also. For example, people say \"he had a beer, and a whiskey to boot.\" This means that the person had a beer, and also had a glass of whiskey.

The day starts with @000 for midnight. Noon is @500. Just before midnight is @999. The thousand parts which make up a day are called \"dot beats\" (.beats). Each dot beat is one minute and 26.4 seconds long. Midnight is the same as Central European Winter Time and Internet Time is the same in all the world. It does not change during the Summer. People can use it to plan phone calls or Internet meetings. Most types of Linux can show Internet Time as the desktop clock.",
   "Physiology": "Physiology is the study of how living things function and the processes involved. Physiologists study how different parts or organs of an organism work together to achieve a particular function. In human beings, for example, the digestion of food involves the action of hormones and other chemicals produced by the stomach, liver, and pancreas. Muscle contraction occurs through the action of chemical messengers produced by nerves that supply the muscle. By learning how the body functions normally, physiologists and physicians are better able to understand what happens when organs function abnormally. For example, an understanding of how the thyroid gland functions has helped in the treatment of a condition called goitre. Studies of the circulatory system and of the nervous system have helped physicians understand and treat such illnesses as heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure.",
   "Dollar": "A dollar is a type of currency. Many countries have named their money \"the dollar\", so in an encyclopaedia article it is important to say which country the dollar is from that is being talked about, for example, the United States dollar or the Canadian dollar.

In English, a person may say \"I like fast cars\", but in Spanish, it is \"me gustan los coches r\u00e1pidos.\" The order of the words has changed: if just the words, without the grammar, are translated into English, it would mean \"to me they please the cars fast\" Even though this is not good English grammar, it is correct in Spanish. This is because Spanish and English have different rules about word order. Grammar is slowly changing. Sentences English speakers find normal today might have seemed strange to people 100 years ago. Some people use grammar that is different from others' when speaking. They might say, \"I didn't do nothing\" rather than \"I didn't do anything.\" They usually do this because that is what is normal in their family or the area where they live.

Literature can also mean imaginative or creative writing, which is looked at for its artistic value.",
   "States of matter": "There are four common states of matter (or physical forms of matter) on earth: solid, liquid, plasma, and gas. In a \"solid\" the positions of atoms are fixed relative to each other over long time. That is due to the cohesion between molecules. This cohesion is provided by metallic, covalent or ionic bonds. But there are many types of intermolecular bonds in the different materials classes: ceramics, metals, semiconductors or polymers, and each material or compound may be different. Only solids can sustain a stress without continually deforming, that means that they can be resistant to deformation. When a solid becomes a liquid, this is called melting. When a solid becomes a gas, this is called sublimation. In a \"liquid\", ionic interactions between molecules are strong enough to keep molecules in contact, but not strong enough to fix a particular structure, and the molecules can continually move with respect to each other. In a \"gas\", the chemical bonds are not strong enough to hold atoms or molecules together, and thus a gas is a collection of independent, unbonded molecules which interact mainly by collision. The most common state of matter in the universe is plasma. Less familiar phases include: quark-gluon plasma; Bose-Einstein condensates and fermionic condensates; strange matter; superfluids and supersolids, and possibly string-net liquids.",
   "Data": "The word data means \"pieces of information\". Types of data include numbers, words, sounds, and images. \"see also data processing, data mining, Data Warehouse, datasheet, Computer program\" \"This article (or an earlier version of it) contains material from FOLDOC, used with permission.\"",

It is available for many different operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, Linux, OS X, FreeBSD and Solaris; and is meant to be an alternative to Microsoft Office. It supports Microsoft Office file formats as well as its own OpenDocument format. The \".org\" part of the name OpenOffice.org is there because OpenOffice is already trademarked. It is often called \"OOo\" for short. OpenOffice.org is based on the older StarOffice software that was created by Sun Microsystems.",
   "Soap bubble": "A soap bubble is a very thin film of soap water. Their shape is a hollow, round ball, or sphere. They have a colorful surface. Soap bubbles do not last very long. Sometimes they break in the air. When they touch something else, they usually break. When people talk about soap bubbles they think about them being pretty, but short-lived. So, they are a symbol for other things that are pretty, but short-lived or unimportant. Children enjoy playing with bubbles. Sometimes, adults enjoy seeing art done with soap bubbles. Soap bubbles solve some mathematical problems. The problems they solve are problems of filling space. Bubbles enclose the largest space with the least surface.",
   "Church": "A church is a \"building\" where people, (usually Christians), come together to worship. Also a religious group is called a church. Large Christian church buildings are called \"cathedrals\". Small churches are called \"chapels\". History of church buildings. In the early days of Christianity people had to worship in secret. Christian worship was not allowed in the Roman empire, so Christians had to meet in a secret place. Sometimes they met in people\u2019s houses or barns, sometimes they met underground. The first places that were built for Christian worship were small chapels that were cut into a rock where people could worship without being discovered. After the death of the Roman emperor Constantine in 337 A.D. Christians were allowed to have buildings to worship in. These first churches were built on a similar plan to Roman basilicas. This plan was later used for the fine Gothic cathedrals and churches that were built at the end of the Middle Ages. The parts of a church. In Roman Catholic churches there is always a stoup (bowl) of holy water near the entrance of the church. This tradition comes from the fact that Roman basilicas had a fountain for washing in front of the entrance. The font is a bowl where people (often babies) are baptized. This is also near the entrance of the church. This is a symbol of the fact that it is welcoming the people into the Christian church. Traditionally the nave has long benches for the congregation to sit on. These are called pews. Some churches may now have replaced their pews with chairs so that they can be moved about for different occasions. At the front of the nave is the pulpit where the priest preaches (these talks are called \u201csermons\u201d). There is also a lectern (like a large music stand) from where the lessons (the Bible readings) are read. If there are aisles along the side of the nave there will be pillars which hold up the roof. In large churches or cathedrals there may be a row of little arches along the top of these pillars. This is called the triforium. Over the triforium is the clerestory which is a row of small windows high up in the church wall. The chancel is the most holy part of the church, and this is why it is often separated from the nave by a screen which can be made of wood or stone, or occasionally iron. The congregation can see through the screen. On the top of the screen there may be a cross. This is called a rood (pronounce like \u201crude\u201d) screen. Priests used to climb up a staircase to the top of the rood screen to read the epistle and the gospel. Sometimes people sung from there. Inside the chancel are the benches where the choir sit. These are called choir stalls. They are on both sides. The two sides of the choir sit facing one another. The choir members who sit on the left (north side) are called \u201ccantoris\u201d (the side where the \u201ccantor\u201d sits) and those on the right (south side) are called \u201cdecani\u201d (the side where the deacon sits). In some large churches or cathedrals the seats for the priests tip up. The top of these seats, when they are tipped up, are called misericords (from the Latin word for \u201cmercy\u201d). This is because the priests or monks were able to lean against them when they got tired if they had to stand up for a long time (it comes from the Latin word for \"mercy\"). Sometimes there are holes in the walls of the screen so that the congregation can see through. These are called squints. If there is a recess in the wall it is called an aumbry. It is a cupboard for communion wine that has been blessed by a priest. The altar may be right at the east end of the church, but in larger churches or cathedrals it is often much further forward. In that case the very east end is called an apse. Sometimes it is a separate chapel called the \u201cLady Chapel\u201d. Churches through the ages. The design of churches changed a lot during the course of history. Often churches were made bigger. When this happened there may be a mixture of architectural styles. These styles vary a lot in different countries. English churches. In the 1600s churches were built in a variety of styles. Often they copied some of the older styles. After the Great Fire of London many new churches were built by the architect Sir Christopher Wren. They were built in the classical style. Churches continued to be built in later centuries like this, but also the Gothic style continued to be used. Modern churches often do not have the traditional cross-shape. It is difficult for the congregation to see and hear what is happening in the chancel. Modern churches bring the congregation, choir and priests in closer touch. An example is the round design for the Church of Christ the Cornerstone in Milton Keynes. Modern churches are often simpler but with a warmer character than the Gothic churches. Many have beautiful mosaic glass windows. Coventry Cathedral is an famous example of a modern church building.",

   "Angola": "Angola is a country in Africa. The capital is Luanda. Angola is situated in the south of the continent.",
   "Vocabulary": "Vocabulary means a list of words. Someone's vocabulary is all the words that he or she knows. A 5 year old would probably know about 5000 words. An adult who has studied at university or college may know at least 20000 words in their language. The vocabulary of a language is always changing. New words are invented or words change their meaning. This means that dictionaries have to be updated. Words to do with computers such as \"download\" are new to the English language. The new word \"bling\" came from hip hop. Words like \"gay\" and \"cool\" have developed new meanings. If someone wanted to try to find out roughly how many words they knew, they could look at a page in a dictionary and count how many of those words they knew (counting things like \u201csing\u201d, \u201csang\u201d, \u201csung\u201d, \u201csinging\u201d as one word). If they multiplied that by how many pages there were in the dictionary they could estimate how many words they knew. It is difficult to be exact. Some words may be understood but not known well enough to be used. Words that are used are part of a person's \u201cactive vocabulary\u201d. Words that are only understood and not used are called \u201cpassive vocabulary\u201d. Sometimes it may not be easy to decide if a word is understood. It may depend on the context. Knowing the \u201ccontext\u201d the word is being used in may make it possible to guess what it means. Without knowing what a \"chough\" is, the phrase \u201cI saw a chough fly off from its nest\u201d would indicate that it is a kind of bird. Someone who knows many words is said to have a \"wide vocabulary\". It is good to develop a wide vocabulary. Knowing lots of words will help with reading and listening to people. It will also help with writing and talking. The English language has a very large vocabulary. This is because of Britain\u2019s history. Every time Britain was invaded, the new people brought new words. There are words from Celts, Anglo Saxons, Vikings, and French. There are also many words from Ancient Greek and Latin. Many of these new words were used as well as the old ones but they may have a different meaning. For example: \"pork\" came from the old French word \"porc\" (pig), but it means food that comes from a pig. In English, some long words may be hard to understand. This could be because they were taken from Latin or Greek. That makes it difficult to guess the meaning of the word. Using big words does not always make the meaning clear. This \u201cSimple English\u201d website tries to use a small vocabulary. There is a lot that can be said in very simple ways.",
   "Preposition": "Prepositions are words or word groups which begin a noun phrase with more than one word. Most prepositions tell where or when, or show possession. Prepositions like \"in\", \"beside\", \"above\", and \"out of\" all tell \"where\", and are usually used with nouns or pronouns. Some examples with the phrases underlined: \"The man sat \"close to\" his wife. He put his arm \"around\" her shoulder. Then he kissed her \"on\" the cheek.\" Prepositions like \"right after\", \"until\", \"during\", and \"before\" all tell \"when\". \"Mr. Prasad had an important meeting \"until\" ten o'clock. \"During\" the meeting, his cell phone rang. It was his wife. She asked him to come straight home \"right after\" work.\" The prepositions \"of\" and \"to\" are used to show possession, or \"belonging-to\": \"This book belongs \"to Vlad.\" The cover \"of the book\" is torn.\"",

It is healthier to eat raw food rather than cooked food, because the nutrients and enzymes are harmed when they are cooked. Raw food is easier to digest than cooked food. People who start to eat only raw foods need time to adjust their diet, because they are used to digesting cooked foods. Most people who start to eat only raw foods start to feel much better. They do not get sick as often as people who eat mostly cooked food, and they also live longer. Germs. Raw food can sometimes make people sick because of germs.",
   "Lana'i": "Lana'i is sixth largest of the Hawaiian Islands, in the United States. It is also known as the \"Pineapple Island\". The island is almost a circle in shape and is 18 miles wide in the longest direction. The land area is 140 sq. miles (367 sq. km). It is separated from the island of Moloka'i by the Kalohi Channel to the north. History. Lana'i was first seen by Europeans on 25 February 1779 by Captain Clerke, with \"HMS Resolution\" on the James Cook Pacific Ocean trip. Clerke took command of the ship after Capt. Cook was killed at Kealakekua Bay on February 14, and was leaving the islands for the North Pacific. In 1922, Jim Dole, the president of Dole Pineapple Company, bought the island of Lana'i. He made a large part of it into the world's largest pineapple plantation. Tourism. Tourism on Lana'i started not long ago. That was when the growing of pineapple was slowly coming to an end in the Islands. On Lana'i, you can be with nature and feel the mood of the Hawaiian countryside. Not like nearby O'ahu, the only town (Lana'i City) is small. It has no traffic or shopping centers. Tourists come mainly to relax. There are three hotels on Lana'i and several golf courses.",
   "Taxonomy": "Taxonomy is a science. It is about the classification of all things living. Although it is most commonly used in biology, it can be used in other types of classification too. Taxonomy is used with different ranks, the lowest is a species. There can also be sub-species. An organism is a species if two organisms of the same kind can mate. This name is the scientific classification of that species. The name is the same all over the world, so that when scientists from different places talk or write about the living thing, they can understand each other. When someone writes about this animal, the first time they write its name they will write \"Felis silvestris catus\". After the first time they write its name, they will only write the first letter of the Genus, so they will write \"F. silvestris catus\". This is known as binomial nomenclature, because it is a way to describe organisms using two names, the common name, and the scientific name. Kingdom --> Phylum --> Class --> Order --> Family --> Genus --> Species A mnemonic, or a saying to help a person remember something, for that is \"King Phillip Came Over From Geneva Switzerland\".",
   "Lime": "Lime is a word to refer to various fruit trees. Most of them are citrus fruit. They are usually associated with the lemon. Limes have a lot of vitamin C. Sailors from Britain were given lemon or lime juice to stop them falling ill with scurvy. This is how they got the nickname \"Limey\". Limes are small, round and bright green. If they stay on the tree for a long time they turn yellow. Then they look like small round lemons. Lime juice is used in cooking and in drinks. Lime oils are often used in perfumes, used for cleaning, and used for aromatherapy.",
   "Cold War": "The Cold War took place between 1945 and 1991. The Cold War was not like any other war, because the two main enemies' armies never actually fought against each other. The term \"Cold\" war is used to describe the relations between the United States and the Soviet Union during the 45 year period after the end of World War II because neither country liked each other. Many people were afraid that it might end in a nuclear war, but that never happened. Conflicting countries. The United States and Soviet Union each had many countries from around the world on their side. The United Kingdom, France, Australia, West Germany, Canada, and the Netherlands were countries on the American side. East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Poland were on the soviet side, and Cuba, North Korea, China, Mongolia and also other countries at different times were friendly to the Soviets. Before the Cold War. The cold war was partially due to the different ways of thinking, both in economy and the way of governing. The United States had adopted capitalism as their economic system while the Soviet Union chose communism, the US was democratic while USSR was nearly a dictatorship. These differences lead to angry relationship between the two countries World War II. The USSR and the United States were allies when World War II happened because neither country liked Nazi Germany. Even though they were allies, they still did not like each other. Soviets thought that the United States and the United Kingdom would not start fighting Germany until Germany had already beat the USSR. The Allies made Germany into four different parts. One part was for the United Kingdom, one part was for France, one part was for the USSR, and one part was for the United States. The city Berlin also was made separate like the country, even though Berlin was in the USSR part of Germany. The three western countries decided to put their parts of Germany back together to make a country called the Federal Republic of Germany (\"Bundesrepublik Deutschland\" or BRD). The USSR made their part of Germany into a country called the German Democratic Republic (\"Deutsche Demokratische Republik\" or DDR). The western parts of Berlin were put together to make a city called West Berlin, which was a BRD enclave inside of the DDR. Complications. The Cold War was related to many local wars, such as the U.S led Korean War, Soviet invasions of Hungary and Czechoslovakia and the Vietnam War, also organized by the United States. These wars, when two small countries fight each other with help from powerful countries, are called proxy wars. The Cuban Missile Crisis was a part of the Cold War, and Middle East Crisis has also become much more complicated because of the Cold War. Resolutions during the Cold War. Western democracies and the Soviet Union discussed World War II at conferences in Tehran (November-December 1943), Yalta (February 1945), and Potsdam (July-August 1945). In the end. After Stalin's death, East-West relations got better, but were never completely healed. A final phase during the late 1980s happened under the Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, who hoped for a healing between the two states that could address many world problems. However, this never happened, because the peoples who lived in the Soviet Union decided to do away with Communism, since it had failed them for 80 years and denied them basic freedoms. By 1990, the Soviet Union broke apart into many countries, the Berlin Wall was torn down, the nations of Eastern Europe had multi-party democracies, and the Cold War was over.",
   "Acceleration": "Acceleration is a measure of how fast velocity changes. Acceleration is the change of velocity divided by the change of time. Acceleration is a vector, and therefore includes both a size and a direction. Finding acceleration. Sometimes the change in velocity formula_7 is written as \u0394formula_8. Sometimes the change in time formula_9 is written as \u0394t. Units of measurement. Acceleration has its own units of measurement. For example, if velocity is measured in meters per second, and if time is measured in seconds, then acceleration is measured in meters per second squared (m/s2). Other words. Acceleration can be positive or negative. Positive acceleration is called acceleration, or speeding up. Negative acceleration is called deceleration, or slowing down. Newton's second law of motion. There are rules for how things move. These rules are called \"laws of motion\". Isaac Newton is the scientist who made the main laws of motion. According to Newton's Second Law of Motion, acceleration formula_10 is connected to force formula_11, and mass formula_12. D'Alembert have also proven that \"F-ma=0 That means whatever may be the force acting on a body same amount of deaccelerating force is acting in it. Acceleration is part of physics. Using calculus, acceleration is the derivative, or rate of change, of velocity. The force something needs to accelerate an object depends on the object's mass: the amount of \"stuff\" the object is made from.",
   "Rudyard Kipling": "Joseph Rudyard Kipling (December 30, 1865 - January 18, 1936) was an English author and poet. He wrote the children's book \"The Jungle Book\". He also wrote the well-known poems, \"If \u2014\" and \"Gunga Din\". Death. Kipling is buried in Westminster Abbey.",
   "Shape of the universe": "Shape of the Universe means two things. There are three ways the universe can be shaped: saddle-like, spherical, or flat. Triangle's angles' sums are different in each.",
   "Swahili language": "Swahili language is a language widely spoken in East Africa. In Swahili language is named is Kiswahili. It is a Bantu language. Swahili language is spoken in a wide area from southern Somalia to northern Mozambique and the whole of Kenya. There are about five million first-language speakers and fifty million second-language speakers. Swahili has become a language with which people can communicate for East Africa and surrounding areas. Swahili language began to be spoken in Zanzibar, an island of Tanzania. Swahili languages is an official language in Tanzania and Kenya. It has been influenced by many other languages like Arabic language. Vocabulary. The below are examples of Swahili language.",
   "Airport": "An airport is a place where airplanes can land or takeoff. Most airports in the world have only a long strip of level ground called a runway. Many airports have buildings which are used to hold airplanes and passengers. A building that holds passengers waiting for their planes or luggage is called a terminal, and the sections between the plane and the terminal are called \"gates\". Airports also have buildings called hangars to hold planes when they are not used. Some airports have control buildings like towers to control where planes go. An international airport is a large airport that airplanes can use to fly to (and from) other countries. Most international airports have shops and restaurants. An airport used by the military is often called an air force base or airbase. An aircraft carrier is a floating airbase. Safety. Today, many airports think that safety is very important. People must walk through a metal detector, a machine that can tell if metal goes through it. If it makes a noise, the officers will make that person take off all things on them that are metal. They also have X-Ray machines that can look into luggage. If officers find items such as weapons, guns, or anything that can be used to kill people, they have that item (and mostly the person who has it) taken away.",
   "Photon": "Photons (from Greek \u03c6\u03c9\u03c2, meaning \"light\"), in many atomic models in physics, are particles which transmit light. In other words, light is carried over space by photons. Photons have a rest mass 0 (zero). They have mass because of Einstein's theory of relativity. At the speed of light photons do have certain mass. A photon is usually given the symbol \u03b3 (gamma), Properties. Photons are fundamental particles. Although they can be created and destroyed, their lifetime is infinite. As photons have energy, they are affected by gravity. In a vacuum, all photons move at the speed of light, c, which is equal to 299,792,458 meters (approximately 300,000 kilometers) per second. A photon has a given wavelength, which determines its color. Even beyond the visible range, wavelength is the only thing different between X-Ray photons, and warm infrared. The last usable property of a photon is its polarity. If you saw a giant photon coming straight at you, it could appear as a swath whipping vertically, horizontally, or somewhere in between. Polarized sunglasses stop photons swinging up and down from passing. This is how they reduce glare as light bouncing off of surfaces tend to fly that way. LCD screens also use polarity to control which light passes through. Even some animals can see light polarization. Finally, light has a spin to it. A photon's spin is a subtle feature, and requires expensive equipment to detect. Photon spin may become the ones and zeros of tomorrow's supercomputers.",
   "Lake Michigan": "Lake Michigan is one of the five Great Lakes in North America. It has a surface area of 22,300 square miles (57,750 square km). It is 307 miles long by 118 miles wide. Lake Michigan is the 5th largest lake in the world. It is bounded by the U.S. states of Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan. The largest city on Lake Michigan is Chicago."
