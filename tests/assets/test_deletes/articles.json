   "April": "April is the fourth month of the year with 30 days. The name April comes from that Latin word \"aperire\" which means \"to open\". This probably refers to growing plants in spring. April begins on the same day of week as \"July\" in all years and also \"January\" in leap years. April's flower is the Sweet Pea and its birthstone is the Diamond. The meaning of the Diamond is Innocence. April in poetry. Poets use \"April\" to mean the end of winter. For example: \"April showers bring May flowers.\"",
   "Air": "Air means Earth's atmosphere. It is the clear gas we live in and breathe in. It has no color or smell. It has weight. Air creates atmosphere pressure. There is no air in the vacuum and cosmos. Air is a mixture of 78.03% Nitrogen, 20.99% Oxygen, 0.94% Argon, 0.03% Carbon Dioxide, 0.01% Hydrogen, 0.00123% Neon, 0.0004% Helium, 0.00005% Krypton, 0.000006% Xenon. Humans need the oxygen in the air to live. In the human body, the lungs give oxygen to the blood, and give back carbon dioxide to the air. Plants and animals also need air to live: it is very important to everyone. The wind is moving air. Air can be polluted from gas, smoke, and ash. Some believe that this pollution may be one of the causes of global warming. Air is also what planes fly through and what politicians are full of. There are three things in air, Nitrogen (79%), oxygen (20%), and other types of gases (1%).",
   "Autonomous communities of Spain": "Spain is divided in 17 parts called autonomous communities. \"Autonomous\" means that each of these autonomous communities has its own Executive Power, its own Legislative Power and its own Judicial Power. These are similar, but NOT the same, to states in the United States of America, for example. Spain has fifty smaller parts called provinces. In 1978 these parts came together, making the autonomous communities. Before then, some of these provinces were together but were broken. The groups that were together once before are called \"historic communities\": Galicia, Pa\u00eds Vasco and Catalu\u00f1a. These communities have 2 official languages: Spanish and their own language (gallego or eusquera or catal\u00e1n). Spain also has two cities on the north coast of Africa: Ceuta and Melilla. They are called \"autonomous cities\".",
   "Alan Turing": "Alan Mathison Turing (June 23, 1912 - June 7, 1954) was an English mathematician and computer scientist. He was one of the first people to work with modern digital computers. He was the first person to think of using a computer for different things. He told people that computers could run different programs. Turing introduced the idea of a Turing machine in 1936. The machine was imaginary, and ran a set of commands. Turing also thought of the Turing test. During the Second World War, Turing was a main participant in the efforts to break German ciphers. On the basis of cryptanalysis he he helped to break both the Enigma machine and the 42 (a teletype cipher attachment codenamed \"Tunny\" by the British), and was, for a time, head of Hut 8, the section responsible for reading German naval signals. Alan Turing was a gay man. In 1952, Turing admitted having sex with a man. At that time in England, homosexuality was a crime. He was tried and convicted of this crime in a British court. and was forced to make a choice. He had to choose between going to jail or \"chemical castration\" (taking female hormones like estrogen to lower his sex drive). He chose the hormones. But this made him impotent (unable to have sex) and made him grow breasts. After suffering these effects for two years, he committed suicide (killed himself) with an apple poisoned with cyanide in 1954. This kind of treatment is now believed to be very wrong, going against medical ethics and international laws of human rights, and malpractice by most doctors.",
   "Adobe Illustrator": "\"Adobe Illustrator\" is a computer program for making graphic design and illustrations. It is made by Adobe Systems. Pictures created in \"Adobe Illustrator\" can be made bigger or smaller, and look exactly the same at any size. It works well with the rest of the products with the Adobe name. History. It was first released in 1986 for the Apple Macintosh. The latest version is \"Adobe Illustrator CS2\", part of Creative Suite 2.",
   "Farming": "Farming is the growing of crops or keeping of animals by people for food and raw materials. Farming can be called agriculture. Overview. Agriculture is not only growing food for people and animals, but also growing other things like flowers, ornamental plants (plants people use to improve the look of their homes) and nursery plants (plants people buy to grow food on their own farms and land), manure or dung, animal hides (skins or furs), leather, industrial chemicals (starch, ethanol, and plastics), fibers (cotton, wool, hemp, and flax), fuels (methane, biodiesel, biomass), and drugs (biopharmaceuticals, marijuana, opium) Agriculture started at least about 10,000 years ago, but no one knows for sure how old it is. Agriculture and domestication started in the Fertile Crescent in East Africa and in the Middle East. The area called Fertile Crescent is now in the countries of Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, and Egypt. Wheat and barley are some of the first crops people grew. People probably started agriculture slowly by planting a few crops, but still gathered (got) many foods from the wild. People may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change. Farming can feed many more people than gathering on the same amount of land. Farming actually started with the first nations. They might have originally kept tethered (tied with a rope) animals for extra food. Scientists have many theories about how farming started but most start with first nations, around the end of the ice age (about ten thousand years ago). Many people live by doing what is called subsistence agriculture, on a small farm. Only the farmer's family lives on the farm. Subsistence agriculture is growing only enough food to feed the farmer, his family, and his animals. Extra food or animals are sold for money or other things the farmer cannot grow. The yield is the amount of food grown on a given amount of land, and the yield is often low. This is because subsistence farmers are generally less educated, and they have less money to buy equipment. When yields are low, forests are sometimes cut to provide new land to grow more food. This is good in the short term, but can be bad for the country and the surrounding environment over many years. In rich countries, farms are often much larger. The yield on farms has gotten bigger in the last one hundred years because farmers are able to grow better varieties of plants, use more fertilizer, use more water, and more easily control weeds and pests. Many farms also use machines, which cut down on the number of people needed to farm the land. This results in fewer farmers in rich countries, but the farms are able to produce more food. This kind of intensive agriculture comes with its own set of problems. Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers, pesticides (chemicals that kill bugs), and herbicides (chemicals that kill weeds). These chemicals can pollute the soil or the water. They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals, causing outbreaks of these pests. The soil can be damaged by erosion (blowing or washing away), salt buildup, or loss of structure. Irrigation (adding water from rivers) can pollute water and lower the water table. Having fewer farmers also changes society and can make a country less able to feed itself in bad times. Agriculture techniques. Farmers select plants with better yield, taste, and nutritional value. They also chose plants that are more resistance to disease, more tolerant to drought, and those that are easier to harvest. Centuries of careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. The crops produce better yield with other techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, irrigation). For example, the yields of wheat in France are over 90 ha. In South America, the yields are 20 qx/ha. In Africa, the yields are less than 10 qx/ha. Some companies have been searching for new plants in poor countries, and genetically modify these plants to improve them. They then try to patent the seeds and sell them back to the poor countries. New plants were created with genetic engineering. One example of genetic engineering is modifying a plant to resist an herbicide. Food. It is important for there to be enough food for everyone. The food must also be safe and of good quality. Some people say the food is not always good. They say it is sometimes not safe, because it contains some chemicals. Other people say intensive agriculture is damaging the environment. For this reason, there are several types of agriculture. Traditional agriculture is mostly done in poor countries. Intensive agriculture is mostly done in wealthier countries. It uses pesticides, machinery, chemical fertilizers. Organic farming is using only natural products. Integrated farming is using local resources, and trying to use the waste from one process as a resource in another process. Problems in agriculture. There are some serious problems that face people trying to grow food today. If the plants get a big amount of water they can die, if they get a small amount of water they can dry up and die, so that's why all plants need a perfect amount of water depending on what type of plant it is. Crops. The major crops produced in the world in 2002, are maize (corn), wheat, rice, and cotton. \"See also\": List of domesticated plants, List of vegetables, List of herbs, List of fruit, List of domesticated animals See also. There are specialty producers who raise less common types of livestock or plants. Aquaculture, the farming of fish, shrimp, and algae, is closely associated with agriculture. Apiculture, the culture of bees, traditionally for honey, increasingly for crop pollination. Animal husbandry means breeding and raising animals for meat or to harvest animal products (like milk, eggs, or wool) on a continual basis.",
   "Addition": "Addition is the mathematical way of putting things together. Arithmetic. In arithmetic, addition is finding the total of two or more numbers. The sign for addition is \"+\". The name for the sign \"+\" is \"plus\". Counting examples. For example, there are objects in two groups. The objects are small circles: \"o\". One group has five of these objects. The other group has 3 of these objects. To find the total number of objects in both groups, the objects can be counted. Another way to find the number of objects in both groups is to add the numbers in each group. Adding. In another counting example, Sally and Bill have 2 children. Sally and Bill get 3 more children. Sally and Bill have added three children to their two children and now have five children. A measurement example. Tom's house<------------300 meters-------------->Bob's house<-----120 meters----->Sally's house The distance from Tom's house to Sally's house can be found by adding the distances already measured. The distance from Tom's house to Bob's house added to the distance from Bob's house to Sally's house is the same as the distance from Tom's house to Sally's house. That is, three hundred meters plus 120 meters. Addition as increase. Addition can also mean to make bigger. Less simple. \"Addition\" is the arithmetic operation for finding the total, or sum, of two or more numbers. If you are adding three or more terms together, mathematicians call those numbers \"summands;\" if you are only adding two numbers they are called the \"augend\" and the \"addend.\" Augend + addend = sum; summand + summand + summand = sum. The addition expression 3 + 8 = 11 is spoken as \"three plus eight equals eleven.\" Adding two numbers together is a dyadic operation. Addition of summands is calculated by putting dyadic additions together. formula_1",
   "Australia": "Australia is a continent in the Southern Hemisphere between the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. The country called Australia occupies the whole of this continent. Its official name is the Commonwealth of Australia. Australia is the sixth biggest country in the world. Many people also call Australia the \"lucky country.\" The continent of Australia and the islands of New Zealand are called Australasia. The islands nearby are Oceania. Geography. The continent of Australia, including the island of Tasmania, was separated from the other continents of the world many millions of years ago. Because of this, many animals and plants live in Australia that are not found anywhere else. These include animals like the kangaroo, the koala, the emu, the kookaburra, and the platypus. People first arrived in Australia more than 50,000 years ago. These native Australians are called the Australian Aborigines. For the history of Australia, see History of Australia. Most of the Australian colonies, having been settled from Britain, became mostly independent democratic states in the 1850s and all six combined as a federation on 1 January 1901. The first prime minister of Australia was Edmund Barton in 1901. Australia is a member of the United Nations and the Commonwealth of Nations. It is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy with the British monarch as Head of State. Regions and cities. Australia has six states, two major mainland territories, and other minor territories. The states are New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia.The two major mainland territories are the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). In July 2007 Australia had just over 21 million people. Most Australians live in cities along the coast, such as Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Darwin, Hobart and Adelaide. The largest inland city is Canberra, which is also the nation's captital. The largest city is Sydney. Although Australia is a very big country, a lot of the land is very dry. The middle of the continent is mostly desert. Only the areas around the east and south coast have enough rain and a suitable climate (not too hot) for many farms and cities. Aboriginal people. The Australian Aboriginal people arrived in Australia more than 50,000 years ago. Until the arrival of English settlers in 1788, the Aboriginal people lived by hunting and gathering food from the land. They managed the land in a way that meant there was usually plenty of food. An example of Aboriginal land management was the Cumberland Plain where Sydney is now. Every few years the Aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees. This meant that a lot of grass grew back, but not many big trees. Kangaroos like to live on grassy plains, but not in forests. The kangaroos that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the Aboriginal people.The aboriginies would name a person after an animal, and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population. Aboriginal people did not usually build houses, except huts of grass, leaves and bark. They did not usually build walls or fences, because there were no horses, cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens. The only Aboriginal buildings that are known are fish-traps made from stones piled up in the river, and the remains of a few stone huts in Victoria and Tasmania. The Aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth. In some parts of Australia the people used sharp flaked-stone spearheads, but most Aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood. Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making. The Aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them. They believed that they had grown from the land, so it was like their mother, and they belonged to the land. Terra Australis. In the 1600s, Dutch merchants traded with the islands of Batavia now (Indonesia), to the north of Australia and several different Dutch ships touched on the coast of Australia. The Dutch Governor, van Diemen, sent Abel Tasman on a voyage of discovery and he found Tasmania, which he named Van Diemen's Land. Its name was later changed to honour the man who discovered it. The British Government were sure that there must be a very large land in the south, that hadn't been explored. They sent Captain James Cook to the Pacific Ocean. His ship, H.M.S. \"Endeavour\" carried the famous scientists, Sir Joseph Banks and Dr Solander who were going to Tahiti where they would watch the planet Venus pass in front of the Sun. Captain Cook's secret mission was to find \"Terra Australis\" (the Land of the South). The voyage of discovery was very successful, because they found New Zealand and sailed right around it. Then they sailed westward. At last, a boy, William Hicks, who was up the mast spotted land on the horizon. Captain Cook named that bit of land Point Hicks. They sailed up the coast and Captain Cook named the land that he saw \"New South Wales\". At last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food. Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were. They collect hundreds of plants to take back to England. Captain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life. He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit. But there were no houses and no fences. In most parts of the world, people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land. But the Aboriginal people didn't own the land in that way. They belonged to the land, like a baby belongs to its mother. Captain Cook went home to England and told the Government that no-one owned the land. This was to cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people. Settlement. In the 1700s, in England, there was a very serious problem with the laws. A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread. Many people were hanged for small crimes. But usually they were just thrown in gaol. Often they were sent away to the British Colonies in America. But in 1770, the colonies in America became the United States. They were free from British rule and would not take England's convicts any more. By the 1780s the gaols (jails) of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships. The Government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there. In 1788 the First Fleet of eleven ships set sail from Portsmouth carrying convicts, sailors, marines, a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years. Their leader was Captain Arthur Phillip. They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered, named Botany Bay, because of the plants found there by the two scientists. Captain Phillip found that Botany Bay was flat and windy. There was not much fresh water. He went with two ships up the coast and sailed into a great harbour which he said was \"the finest harbour in the world!\" There were many small bays on the harbour so he decided on one which had a good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on. On the 26th January, 1788, the flag was raised and New South Wales was claimed in the name of King George III of England, and the new settlement was called Sydney. For the first few years of the settlement, things were very difficult. No-one in the British Government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony. Nobody had chosen them carefully. There was only one man who was a farmer. There was no-one among the convicts who was a builder, a brickmaker or a blacksmith. No-one knew how to fix the tools when they broke. The cattle all escaped. There were no cooking pots. All the plants were different so no-one knew which ones could be eaten. There was a grave danger that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation. Somehow, the little group of tents with a hut for the Governor, Arthur Phillip, and another hut for the supply of food, grew into a small town with streets, a bridge over the stream, a windmill for grinding grain and warves for ships. By the 1820s there was a fine brick house for the Governor. There was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today. Settlements had spread out from Sydney, firstly to Norfolk Island and to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania), and also up the coast to Newcastle, where coal was discovered, and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd. Spanish Merino sheep had been brought to Sydney, and by 1820, farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of England. While the settlement was growing in New South Wales, it was also growing in Tasmania. The climate in Tasmania was more like that of in England, and farmers found it easy to grow crops there. Exploration. Because Australia is such a very large land, it was easy to think that it might be able to hold a very large number of people. In the early days of the colony, a great number of explorers went out, searching for good land to settle on. When the settlers looked west from Sydney, they saw a range of mountains which they called the Blue Mountains. They were not very high and didn't look very rugged but for many years no-one could find their way through them. In 1813 Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and a 17 year-old called William Charles Wentworth crossed the Blue Mountains and found land on the other side which was good for farming. A road was built and the Governor, Lachlan Macquarie founded the town of Bathurst on the other side, 100 miles from Sydney. Some people, like Captain Charles Sturt were sure that there must be a sea in the middle of Australia and set out to find it. Many of the explorers did not prepare very well, or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year. Some died like Burke and Wills. Ludwig Leichhardt got lost twice. The second time, he was never seen again. Major Thomas Mitchell was one of the most successful explorers. He mapped the country as he went, and his maps remained in use for more than 100 years. He travelled all the way to what is now western Victoria, and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white person there. The Henty brothers had come from Tasmania, had built themselves a house, had a successful farm and fed the Major and his men on roast lamb and wine. Politics. Australia is made up of six states and two territories. Each of state and territory has its own Parliament and makes its own local laws. The Australian Parliament sits in Canberra and makes laws for the whole country, also known as the Commonwealth or Federation. The Federal government is led by the Prime Minister of Australia, who is the member of Parliament chosen as leader. The current Prime Minister is Kevin Rudd, elected in November 2007. He is the leader of a political party called the Australian Labor Party. The other main party is the Liberal Party The leader of Australia is the Prime Minister, although the Governor-General represents the Queen of Great Britain as head of state. The Governor-General, currently, Her Excellency Ms Quentin Bryce, is chosen by the Prime Minister. Culture. Australia was colonised by people from Britain, but today people from all over the world live there. Australia is multicultural, which means that all its people are helped to keep their different languages, religions and ways of life, while also learning English and joining in with other Australians. The famous artists, musicians, writers, scientists, soldiers, and sports who are Australian include Patrick White who won a Nobel Prize for his writing, the opera singer Dame Joan Sutherland, the pop singer Kylie Minogue, the cricketer Sir Donald Bradman, the swimmer Ian Thorpe and the athlete Cathy Freeman. Almost all culture in Australia, films, opera, music, painting, theatre, dance, and crafts \u2014 achieve international recognition. From the time of European settlement, a common theme in Australian art has been the Australian landscape. In Australian literature, one can also find very much writings about the Australian landscape. In 1973, Patrick White was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the only Australian to have achieved this; he is recognised as one of the great English-language writers of the twentieth century. Australia has two public broadcasters (the ABC and the multi-cultural SBS), three commercial television networks, three pay TV services, and numerous public, non-profit television and radio stations. Each major city has daily newspapers, and there are two national daily newspapers, The Australian and The Australian Financial Review. Sport. Sport plays an important part in Australian culture, assisted by a climate that favours outdoor activities; 23.5% Australians over the age of 15 regularly participate in organised sporting activities. At an international level, Australia has particularly strong teams in cricket, hockey, netball, rugby league, rugby union, and performs well in cycling, rowing and swimming. Nationally, other popular sports include Australian rules football, horse racing, soccer and motor racing. Australia has participated in every summer Olympic Games of the modern era, and every Commonwealth Games. Australia has hosted the 1956 and 2000 Summer Olympics, and has ranked among the top five medal-takers since 2000. Australia has also hosted the 1938, 1962, 1982 and 2006 Commonwealth Games. Other major international events held regularly in Australia include the Australian Open, one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments, annual international cricket matches and the Formula One Australian Grand Prix. Corporate and government sponsorship of many sports and elite athletes is common in Australia. Televised sport is popular; some of the highest rating television programs include the summer Olympic Games and the grand finals of local and international football competitions.",
   "American English": "American English or U.S. English is the dialect (or rather, a variety of dialects) of English language spoken in the United States. It is different in some ways from other variations of English, such as British English. Historically, many types of American English can be found in old local dialects of England. Many people today know about American English even if they live in a country where another form of English is spoken. This is partly because people hear and read American English via the media, for example CNN television, and the Internet, where the most common form of English is American English. Because people all over the world hear and read American English as well as other versions of English we may find that the English language starts to take on (acquire) new words. English has been changing for centuries, adding new words to its vocabulary. For example, the English language spoken in India & Pakistan, which has more than one billion people, will add more American English words to go along with its British English base and many other words adopted into English usage in India from Indian languages such as Hindi & Urdu. Sometimes people will learn American English as it is spoken in America - for example, in telephone call centers in India and other places, people often learn American English in order to sound more like their customers who call India from America. These people often continue to use American English in everyday life. Many word definitions are different in American English. Most changes in a language start with small things like this - for instance Italian, Spanish, French all came from Latin due to many small changes in use over centuries. See Also. African American Vernacular English",
   "Abbreviation": "An abbreviation is a shorter way to write a word or phrase. People use abbreviations for words that they write a lot. The English language occasionally uses the apostrophe mark ' to show that a word is written in a shorter way, but some abbreviations do not use this mark. More often, they use periods, especially the ones that come from the Latin language. Common Latin abbreviations include i.e. [id est] \"that is\", e.g. [exempli gratia] \"for example\", and et al. [et alia] \"and others\". Some new abbreviations have been created by scientists, by workers in companies and governments, and by people using the Internet. People often think words are abbreviations when in fact they are acronyms. Here are examples of common acronyms: The word \"radar\" is an acronym for \"Radio Detection and Ranging\". The name of the large computer company IBM comes from the words \"International Business Machines\". The name of the part of the United States government that sends rockets into outer space is NASA, from the words \"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\". When people using the Internet think that something is very funny, they sometimes write \"LOL\" to mean \"Laughing Out Loud\". People sometimes write \"ASAP\" for \"As Soon As Possible\".",
   "Native American": "Native Americans (also Aboriginal Peoples, Aboriginal Americans, American Indians, Amerindians, Amerind, Indians, First Nations, First Peoples, Alaskan Natives, Native Canadians, or Indigenous Peoples of America) are those people who were in North America, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean Islands when the Europeans came there. The Europeans were travelling west, so they thought they were going to India. This is why they called the people \"Indians\". Sometimes these people are called \"Indians\", but this is confusing, because it is the same word used for people from India. The words aboriginal or first people or indigenous people are also used. Other names for these for Native Americans are First Nations (in Canada) and \"Red Indians\" (this is not used much any more). There are many different tribes of American Indian people, with many different languages. Many American Indians died after the Europeans came to the Americas, from diseases that came with the Europeans that were new to the Indians, in wars with the Europeans, or because the Europeans made them work as slaves. Most of the American Indians were hurt or killed by settlers who wanted to take their lands. Most people think that the ancestors of American Indians came to the Americas from Asia. Some of them may have come to America over 12,000 years ago when Alaska was connected to Asia by land. Some people think that they came to the Americas even before that. Some of their ancestors may have come along the coastline in small boats or canoes, because sometimes there were glaciers blocking the land between Alaska and Asia. Some Indian tribes and languages of North America are Cherokee, Maya or Yucatec Maya, Aztecs, Navajo, and Sioux. Some Indian tribes and languages of South America are Aymara, Guarani, Quechua, and Tupi.",
   "Algebra": "Algebra is a part of mathematics (maths) that helps show the general links between numbers and math operations (adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing) used on the numbers. Algebra does this by using letters (\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"...) or other symbols to represent numbers, either because the numbers are unknown or because the numbers change during the course of the problem, in which case the letters are called variables. In many math problems, time is a variable, often represented by the letter \"t\". Using the basic ideas in algebra can help reduce a math problem to its simplest form making it easier to solve difficult problems. Algebra is taught in school to help in harder mathematics, science, and engineering classes. Here is a simple example of an algebra problem. Sue has 12 jellybeans, Ann has 24 jellybeans. They decide to share, so that they have same jellybeans. Let \"x\" represent the number of jellybeans Ann gives to Sue. Then we want 12 + \"x\" = 24 - \"x\". Here are steps you can use to solve the problem. 1) Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation. This gives \"x\" = 12 - \"x\". 2) Add \"x\" to both sides of the equation. This gives 2\"x\" = 12. 3) Divide both sides of the equation by 2. This gives \"x\" = 6. If Ann gives Sue 6 jellybeans, they will have the same number of jellybeans. Of course, this problem could be solved without algebra. The purpose of simple story problems such as this one is to teach algebra, so that the students can use algebra when faced with a problem that is too hard to solve any other way. Problems such as building a freeway, designing a cell phone, or finding the cure for a disease all require alegbra. In addition to \"elementary algebra\", or basic algebra, there are advanced forms of algebra, taught in colleges and universities, such as abstract algebra, linear algebra, and universal algebra. Algebra can be used to solve real problems because the rules of algebra work in real life and numbers can be used to represent the values of real things. Writing algebra. In algebra, adding \"z\" to \"y\" (or \"y\" plus \"z\") is written as y + z. Subtracting \"z\" from \"y\" (or \"y\" minus \"z\") is written as y \u2212 z. In algebra, multiplying \"y\" by \"z\" (or \"y\" times \"z\") can be written in 4 ways: y \u00d7 z, y*z, y\u00b7z, or yz. yz is the most usual form of writing the product of \"y\" and \"z\" in algebra. When we multiply a number and a letter in algebra, we write the number in front of the letter: 5 \u00d7 y = 5y. When the number is 1, then the 1 is not written because 1 times any number is that number (1 \u00d7 \"y\" = \"y\") and so is not necessary. When we multiply 2 numbers in algebra, the only way is usually 3\u00b74. \u00d7 is not used, because it looks too much like the letter x. In algebra, dividing \"y\" by \"z\" (or \"y\" over \"z\") is written as y \u00f7 z or y/z. y/z is more commonly used. Graphing algebra. Algebra also introduces graphing and the basic formula formula_1 where \"b\" is the y-intercept of the graph and \"m\" is the slope. This formula applies to the coordinates of the graph or formula_2. History. The word \"algebra\" is a Latin form of the Arabic word \"Al-Jabr\" (\"casting\") and comes from a mathematics book \"Al-Maqala fi Hisab-al Jabr wa-al-Muqabilah\", (\"Essay on the Computation of Casting and Equation\") written in the 9th century by a famous Persian mathematician, Muhammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b, who was a Muslim born in Kharazm in Iran. He flourished under Al-Ma'moun in Baghdad, Iraq through 813-833 AD, and died around 840 AD. The book was brought into Europe and translated into Latin in the 12th century. The book was then given the name 'Algebra'.",
   "Astronomy": "Astronomy is the study of planets, stars, galaxies, and other objects found in outer space. Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences. It was done even before history was written. Astronomy should not be confused with astrology, which is not a science. Early astronomy. The early astronomers were traders and sailors who needed the stars to guide them at night. Farmers, who needed to find out when planting, flooding, or harvesting times were coming, looked at the rising and setting of certain constellations in the sky. Ancient people who built things like Stonehenge, and the native North American medicine wheels, probably studied the sky for religious or sacred reasons. All these people needed accurate knowledge of the phases of the Moon, the most north and most south seasonal points of the sun, and other information for their purposes. Some people called astrologers believe they can predict the future by studying where the planets are in the sky when a person is born. Astrology is not regarded as a science these days. In the past, astrology and astronomy were closely linked, and people kept careful records of what they saw. These records have been very important to astronomers during the past two centuries, as they were trying to understand the Universe. History of astronomy. Early people studied the stars using only their eyes as telescopes and binoculuars had not yet been invented. People saw some of the planets such as Mars and Venus, and studied Earth's Moon. People made maps of the stars positions and movements and used these for navigation. Early astronomers thought that the Sun and the stars went around or orbited the Earth. This was what everyone believed for hundreds of years. But later, during a time called the Renaissance, a man called Nicolaus Copernicus proved that the Earth moves around the sun. He came up with the idea of a Solar System where the Earth and planets move around the Sun. His idea was improved on by an important man called Galileo Galilei. Galileo helped to create the telescope which made it possible for people to see things much farther away. Galileo got into trouble with the church though because he argued against the idea that Earth was the center of everything. The Pope passed an order that made Galileo stay in his house and publish no books for most of his life. After Galileo, people used telescopes more often and began to see further-away objects such as the planets Uranus and Neptune. They also saw how stars were similar to our Sun, but in a range of colours and sizes and other far away objects such as nebula. Since the 20th century astronomy has progressed a lot. It is now possible to use very big telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope to look at stars and galaxies billions of miles away. Astronomers now use giant transmitters to look at things using x rays and radio waves. Astronomy Equipment. To study astronomy on a basic level you can just use your eyes. Looking at something with just your eyes is called using your naked eye. Many stars are too far away to see with your eyes: you need binoculars or a telescope to see them. Kinds of astronomy. Astronomy has become a very large science in the past few hundred years, and there are many different types of astronomy. Lunar astronomers study the moon, while planetary astronomers study the planets near our sun, and the planets near other stars. Some astronomers study special types of stars, like when two stars are next to each other. Other astronomers study distant galaxies, which are very large groups of many stars. There are also astronomers who never look at the sky at all. These \"theoretical\" astronomers use physics and mathematics in combination with computers to create \"models\" of how the universe behaves, then they compare their models to what is observed. They want to understand and predict the events which happen in the universe, and understand how the universe was formed.",
   "Architecture": "Architecture is the design of structures; how they are built. An architect must study for many years to become qualified. The purpose of most architecture is shelter. On a small scale, a garden shed or a stable are examples of simple architecture. On a large scale, architecture may mean the designing of whole towns and cities. In a more general sense, architecture can be the designing of any kind of thing, from a chair to a computer. The word architect is even starting to be used as a verb. A person might 'architect' a system. (This is not correct English, but it is an example of how language changes and develops). The Word Architecture. The word architecture seems to suggest something higher, more noble, than simply the designing of a building. A successful building should speak of wisdom handed down through thousands of years. Sadly that wisdom is very often ignored. Most new construction is poor in design and materials. People rip out delicate, elegant wooden windows and replace them with crude, heavy white plastic 'units'. They throw away lightweight slates, split by hand from the mountains, which have turned the softest shades of grey, only because the nails holding them on have rusted. They replace them with heavy concrete tiles dyed red, which make the beams of the roof dip. They build shelves and closets from chipboard (woodpulp and glue, pressed tight to make an imitation of wood). These have no grain like real wood, so they dip and collapse with only a small amount of weight. History. In the past, people built huts and wood houses to shelter from the weather. For reasons of cost, the houses were simple and small. For safety, they were often close together. Great civilizations like the Ancient Egyptians built large temples and structures, like the pyramids. The Ancient Greeks and Romans made what we now call Classical Architecture. The Romans, working over 2000 years ago, copied the arch from the Etruscans, who copied it from the Mesopotamians. The stone columns which still hold up so many important buildings, like the Parthenon in Athens, were simply copied from the first wooden posts. Classical Architecture is very formal, it always obeyed laws. It used symmetry, which really means balance, and it used proportion which means keeping shapes to certain patterns. The Golden Mean was a rule (or law) which said, (to put it very simply) if you are making a room, or any other thing, it will work best if you always make the long side 1.6 times longer than the short side. There are many laws in Classical Architecture, like how high the middle of an arched bridge needs to be (which depends on how wide the bridge needs to be). These laws were learned from centuries of experience and they are as true today as they were 2000 years ago. In some parts of the world, like India, the architecture is famous for stone carving on temples and palaces. Different architectural styles were made in China, Japan, Southeast Asia, Africa, Mexico, and Central and South America. Later, people in Western Europe in the Middle Ages made Romanesque architecture, then Gothic architecture. Gothic buildings have tall, pointed windows and arches. Many churches have Gothic architecture. Castles were also built at this time. In Eastern Europe, churches usually had domes. People were copying the Classical Architecture from the past, but adding their own ideas and decoration. Then in the 18th Century the Industrial Revolution happened and people began to invent machines to make things quickly and cheaply. Many factories and mills were built during, or after this revolution. 100 years later, in the Victorian era, architects like George Fowler Jones and Decimus Burton still followed the Gothic style, to build new churches. But towards the end of the 19th Century, architects began to use the newer, cheaper materials like metal girders and reinforced concrete to build. An example is the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Buildings can now be built taller than ever before. We call them skyscrapers. This new technology has made us free from traditional limitations, but it has also made us free from the ancient laws. Modernism, which started as early as 1890, has resulted in some handsome, impressive buildings, like the Chrysler Building in New York, but also some truly horrible buildings. The ancient laws have been forgotten, or ignored, as architects have become more interested in doing something 'original'. It seems incredible that we can make these mistakes, when our ancestors built with such skill and beauty. Our wide use of, and dependance on, machines has made many of us think like machines. The famous Modernist architect Le Corbusier once said \"A house is a machine for living in\". We have come a long way since our first mud huts, but perhaps we have also lost something along the way.",
   "Anatomy": "Anatomy is the study of the bodies of living beings (people, animals, plants). It is like taking the body apart, and looking at its parts (organs, muscles and bones). People who study \"anatomy\" then look where a certain organ (or bone, or muscle) should be, or where it normally is.",
   "Asteroid": "An asteroid is like a planet, but smaller. The name \"asteroid\" means \"like a star\" in the ancient Greek language. Asteroids may look like small stars in the sky, but they really do move around the Sun, while stars only seem to move because the Earth spins. Like planets, asteroids do not make their own light. Because of this, some people think \"asteroids\" is not a good name, and think that the name \"planetoid\" (\"like a planet\") would be a better name. Most asteroids are made of rock, but some are made of ice or metal. Most asteroids in our Solar System are in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Formation. Asteroids are the leftover rock and other material from the formation of the Solar System. These rocks were too small to make a planet, and could not collide to form one. Discovery. In the 1600s, Gisuppe Piazzi discovered the first asteroid. It was named Ceres, and is the biggest object in the asteroid belt. Other asteroids, like Juno, Pallas, and Vesta were discovered later. Today, astronomers know of hundreds of thousands of asteroids, which range from fractions of a mile to 600 miles across.",
   "Archaeology": "Archaeology is the study of the past by looking for the remains and relics (historical things) left by the people who lived before us. These are called \"artifacts\", and can include old coins, tools, buildings and garbage (rubbish). Archaeologists try to work out what these remains mean. To find these remains, archaeologists often have to dig deep in the ground. This is called fieldwork. When things are found, or even when nothing is found, the results of the fieldwork are taken back to the place where the archaeologist is based, perhaps a University or museum. Every piece of information is written down or put into a computer, so that a picture can be built up. As settlements (places where people lived in groups) change and grow, what went before is often buried. Ancient Rome, for example, is now up to 40 feet (12 metres) below the present city. This is why archaeology is expensive and why it takes so long. Sometimes archaeologists find the bones of dead people and the things they used, or the houses they lived in. Archaeologists think it is important to understand the past, because so many people use the past to know where they come from. Archaeologists have many different 'fields of interest', which means they do not all study the same things. Some study Ancient Egypt and are called Egyptologists; others study Ancient Greece, or the Vikings. Archaeologists study every civilization that is known, especially the ones where there is no history to read. They can study any time period. For example, one might study the beginning of human life in Africa, or one might study World War II. Some archaeologists study things that are now underwater. They search for sunken ships or cities that have been lost under the sea. Stonehenge, in England is a famous archaeological site, or place. Other famous sites include Angkor Wat, Machu Picchu, and Great Zimbabwe. In many countries, governments and other groups of people protect important sites so that they will not be destroyed and so that visitors can always come and see them. Sometimes archaeological sites are found when foundations are dug for new buildings. Archaeologists have to work quickly when this happens, because people building are always in a hurry. Quite often as soon as the archaeologists have finished their work, the remains that they have found will be covered over, unless they are of very great importance.",
   "Application": "The word application has several uses. Medicine. In medicine, application means putting some drug or ointment usually on the skin where it is absorbed into the human body. Computers. When dealing with computers, an application is a type of computer program. At the direction of some user, perhaps set up once and executed many times, this performs a well-defined mathematical or communications function, or retrieves information, or displays or edits a document. How well this works depends not only on the code of the program, but also on the operating system and physical attributes of the computer such as how fast its processor is and how much memory is available. Physically, the bits making up the application can be on the boot device or a data device, or a device of their own. Usually, some basic applications like a text editor, file browser and telnet do go on the boot device to be sure that they are always available even if only the boot is accessed. If the bits are on a non-boot device, they may not always be found when required. In the Microsoft Windows operating system, the user may be asked to find the application that is used to run a specific file. Common types of applications available free of charge include web browsers, email programs, media players, and instant messaging software. Business. In business or government, an application is a (usually paper) form filled out and handed in by a person seeking a privilege from a state or company, such as work, credit, some type of license or permit, or a place to live. Engineering. At work, generally engineering, when dealing with certain materials or objects, an \"application\" is a purpose that material or object can be used for. Wood and steel have many applications.",
   "Basic English": "Basic English is a made-up language written by Charles Kay Ogden. The idea of Basic English is to use easy words to explain harder thoughts. Basic English (\"British American Scientific International Commercial\") has 850 basic words. From the 850 words, 600 are names of things. Most of the words can be learned using pictures. 150 are words to describe things (adjectives) and to describe verbs (adverbs). The last 100 words are verbs and conjunctions. Verbs are words that show actions, and conjunctions are words that help put sentences together. Rules of word use. The word use of Basic English is like full English, but the rules are much simpler, and there are fewer exceptions. Not all meanings of each word are allowed. Ogden's rules of grammar for Basic English help people use the 850 words to talk about things and events in a normal way.",
   "Beijing": "Beijing (Chinese: \u5317\u4eac /B\u011bij\u012bng/) is the capital of the People's Republic of China. The city used to be known as \"Peking\". It is located in the northern and eastern parts of the country. The city of Beijing has played a very important role in the development of China. Many people from different cities and countries come to Beijing to look for better chances to find work. Nearly 15 million people live there. In 2008 Beijing will host the Olympic Games. Beijing is well known for its ancient history. Since the Jin dynasty, Beijing has been the capital of several dynasties, including the Yuan, Ming, Qing, and others. There are many places of historic interest in Beijing. These places include the Summer Palace, the Temple of Heaven, and the Great Wall of China. Name. Beijing means \"the northern capital\" in the Chinese language. It was once a counterpart of Nanjing, \"the southern capital\", during the Ming Dynasty. This dynasty gave Beijing its name. History. The center of Beijing was settled in the 1st millennium BC. In those days, the Kingdom of Yan (\u71d5) set up their capital where Beijing is today. They called it Ji (\u84df). After the Kingdom of Yan was destroyed, the city became smaller, although it was still an important place. Beijing became more important again in the 10th century, when the Jin dynasty set its capital there. This city was destroyed by Mongol forces in 1215. Then in 1267, Mongols built a new city on the north side of the Jin capital, and called it \"Great Capital\" (\u5927\u90fd), which was the beginning of modern Beijing. When Kublai Khan, the Mongolian monarch, set up the Yuan dynasty, this city became his capital. The Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties all made Beijing their capitals. When the Qing dynasty lost power and the Republic of China was set up, the new Republic moved its capital from Beijing to Nanjing. When the People's Republic of China seized power, Beijing became the capital of China again. Education. Beijing is the education center of People's Republic of China. More 500 famous universities of China are located in Beijing. They also include 5 of the top universities: Peking University, Tsinghua University, China People University, Beijing Normal University and Beihang University. Beijing is also education center of China for teaching Chinese as a foreign language. The standard Chinese pronunciation is based on Beijing dialect, so over 70% foreigners who want to study Chinese go to Beijing for their studies.",
   "Bottle": "A bottle is a small container used to carry liquids. Bottles can be many different sizes. Bottles are usually made of glass or plastic. Milk, wine, lemonade and water are often put into bottles.",
   "Berry": "The word berry is used for many different kinds of small fruits that has many seeds and can be eaten. Some examples are strawberry, raspberry, blueberry, and lingonberry. A berry can be either one fruit (like strawberry) or many fruits joined together like raspberry). Berries are small, sweet, juicy, bright coloured fruits. Due to this, they are able to bring more animals towards them and spread their seeds. In daily life, grapes, currants, cranberries, blueberries, gooseberries, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and boysenberris, are berries. However, botanists (people who study plants) say that strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and boysenberries are not berries. Instead, they say that tomatoes, eggplants (brinjals), guavas, pomegranates and chillies are berries. Pumpkins, cucumbers, melons, oranges and lemons are modified (changed) berries.",
   "Black": "In light, Black is lack of all color. The pigment is the combination of all colors. However, many people refer to it as: \"the color black\". Meaning of black. Black is associated with power, elegance, formality, death, evil, and mystery. Black is a color associated with fear and the unknown (black holes). It can have a negative meaning (blacklist, 'black death') or a positive meaning ('in the black', 'black is beautiful'). Black can stand for strength and authority. It can be a formal, elegant, and prestigious color (black tie, black Mercedes). In heraldry, black is the symbol of grief. In emo and goth culture, black is a common color for clothing.",
   "Biology": "Biology is the science of life and living things, like plants, animals, fungi (such as mushrooms), and bacteria. People who study biology are called biologists. \"What are the characteristics of this living thing?\" (What makes it different from other living things?) \"How should we group this living thing?\" \"What does this living thing do?\" Biology looks at how animals and other organisms behave and work, and what they are like. Biology also studies how organisms react with each other and the environment. Biology as a science has existed for hundreds of years, and it has many research fields and branches. Many of those branches are seen as independent. Like all sciences, biology uses the scientific method. This means that biologists must be able to show evidence for their ideas, and that other biologists must be able to test the ideas for themselves. History. Biology is known widely as a form of magic which was invented by evil Scottish scientist David Renfrew on a twenty-year long quest to count all the pine needles in the United States. While attempting to find himself, and count such needles, he decided to devise this evil form of magic to torment high school age students.",
   "Brazil": "Brazil is a country in South America. It is the world's fifth largest country. The country has a population of 186 million people. Most people in Brazil speak Portuguese. The capital of Brazil is Bras\u00edlia, a city planned and built from 1957 to 1960. The country also has the world's fourth largest city, S\u00e3o Paulo. Geographics. Brazil has the world's largest forest, the Amazon Rainforest. It makes up 40% of the country's land area. Brazil also has other types of land; there is a type of savanna called \"cerrado\"; there is also a dry plant region named \"caatinga\". Brazil is known for soccer, but it also has many other things: a varied culture (influenced by people who have come from many countries), and a growing economy. Brazil is the largest country and in South America and the largest economy in Latin America. Its people include people of Portuguese or other European descent, African descent, and native Amerindians, as well as many people of mixed origins. The country is the fifth largest in the world by area. It is known for its numerous rainforests and jungles. It neighbours Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay, therefore it borders every country in South America, with the exception of two, Chile and Ecuador. The most important cities are S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Bras\u00edlia, Curitiba, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Porto Alegre, Recife, Fortaleza, Manaus and Vit\u00f3ria. People from Brazil are called Brazillians.",
   "Britain": "Britain is often used as a short name for the United Kingdom (of Great Britain and Northern Ireland). People use this name because most of the UK is on the island of Great Britain. Sometimes the name Britain is used to refer to the island of Great Britain only, especially in historical contexts e.g. 'Roman Britain'. There are three countries on the island of Britain: England, Scotland and Wales. History of the name Britain. The modern name Britain comes from an old Celtic name \"Prydyn\" (or \"Prydein\"). The Irish language name was \"Cruithin\". The old Greek writers heard these names and called the island \"Pritanni\". Scholars now think the word was the name of the Picts (who lived 2,000-1,500 years ago in the north of Britain which is northern Scotland today) in the Welsh and Irish languages. When the Romans came to the island they called it Britannia. Most of Brittania was the home of the Celtic people called the Britons or Brythons who spoke the ancestor language of modern Welsh, Cornish and Breton. When some of these Britons moved to live in north-west France their called their new country by the same name as their old one. It came to be known as 'Breizh' in Breton, and was called Brittany in English (from the French name \"Bretagne\"). To make clear the difference between Brittany and Britain some people started to call the island of Britain \"Great Britain\", because it was bigger than the \"little Britain\" (Brittany) in France.",
   "Computer science": "Computer science is the science of how to treat information. There are many different fields. Some of them look at problems in a more abstract way. Some fields need certain kinds of machines, called computers. A computer scientist will need math, science, and know-how to make and use computers. Asking a question. A computer is a device which takes orders as fast as you can give them to it and works as fast as it can to solve the orders. Asking the right question. Computers can do some things easily (for example, simple math, or sorting a list of names from A-to-Z). Computers cannot do some things, though. Computers cannot answer questions that do not have enough details, or questions that have no answer. Computers can answer some questions, but may take too much time. As an example, it may take too long to find the shortest way through all the towns in the USA, so every so often a computer scientist will look for a nearly full answer (an approximation). A computer will answer these kind of questions much faster. Answering the question. Algorithms have to do with the way computers answer questions. Take playing cards, for example. A computer scientist may want to sort the cards, first by color, and then by order (like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace). The computer scientist may see different ways to sort the playing cards. If the way has a detailed account of how to sort the cards, the scientist has made an algorithm. The scientist first needs to test if the algorithm does what it should in all events. The scientist can then see how well it sorts the cards. A simple, but poor, algorithm would: drop the cards, group them up, and see if they look sorted. If not, do it again. This will work, but will probably take a very long time. A person may better do this by looking through all the cards, finding the one that goes in the first position (2 of diamonds), and putting it at the start. After this, he looks for the second position, and so on. This works much faster, and does not need as much space. Computer science left the other sciences near the end of the 20th century and made its own ways of doing things and its own group of word uses. It has to do with electrical engineering, mathematics, and language science. Computer science looks at the theoretical (not real) parts of computers. Computer engineering looks at the real parts of computers (those that a person could touch), and software engineering looks at the use of computer programs and how to make them.",
   "Computer": "A Computer is a machine that manipulates data according to a set of instructions. Computers are able to do mathematical calculations. Modern computers can do complex mathematical computations -- billions per minute. Computers have been used to control industrial operations, which used to be routine clerical work. Recently, they have spread to the home, where they are used for media, web browsing and desktop applications. History of computing. It is difficult to identify any particular device as the earliest computer. This is because the meaning of the word \"computer\" has changed over time. Originally, the word referred to a person who did numerical calculations (a human computer). Human computers often used mechanical calculating devices to help them solve their problems. The history of the modern computer begins with two separate technologies - that of automated calculation and that of programmability. Examples of early mechanical calculating devices include the abacus, the slide rule and arguably the astrolabe and the Antikythera mechanism (which dates from about 150-100 BC). Hero of Alexandria (c. 10\u201370 AD) built a mechanical theater which performed a play lasting 10 minutes and was operated by a complex system of ropes and drums that might be considered to be a means of deciding which parts of the mechanism performed which actions and when. This is the essence of programmability. The \"castle clock\", an astronomical clock invented by Al-Jazari in 1206, is considered to be the earliest programmable analog computer. It displayed the zodiac, the solar and lunar orbits, a crescent moon-shaped pointer travelling across a gateway causing automatic doors to open every hour, and five robotic musicians who play music when struck by levers operated by a camshaft attached to a water wheel. The length of day and night could be re-programmed every day in order to account for the changing lengths of day and night throughout the year. At the end of the Middle Ages, European mathematics and engineering became more important. In 1623, Wilhelm Schickard constructed a device that is seen as the earliest of a number of mechanical calculators constructed by European engineers. None of these devices fit the modern definition of a computer, because they could not be programmed. In 1801, Joseph Marie Jacquard made an improvement to the textile loom that used a series of punched paper cards as a template to allow his loom to weave intricate patterns automatically. The resulting Jacquard loom was an important step in the development of computers because the use of punched cards to define woven patterns can be viewed as an early, but limited, form of programmability. Only when automatic calculation was combined with programmability did the first computers in the modern sense result. In 1837, Charles Babbage was the first to make a design of a fully programmable mechanical computer. He called it the \"The Analytical Engine\". Because Babbage did not have enough money and could not resist changing the design all the time, he never built his Analytical Engine. Large-scale automated data processing of punched cards was performed for the U.S. Census in 1890 by tabulating machines designed by Herman Hollerith and manufactured by the Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation, which later became IBM. By the end of the 19th century a number of technologies that would later prove useful in the realization of practical computers had begun to appear: the punched card, Boolean algebra, the vacuum tube (thermionic valve) and the teleprinter. During the first half of the 20th century, many scientific computing needs were met by increasingly sophisticated analog computers, which used a direct mechanical or electrical model of the problem as a basis for computation. However, these were not programmable and generally lacked the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers. Several developers of ENIAC saw its problems. They invented a more flexible and elegant design, which is known as \"stored program architecture\" or von Neumann architecture. This design was first formally described by John von Neumann in the paper \"First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC\", distributed in 1945. A number of projects to develop computers based on the stored-program architecture started around this time, the first of these was completed in Great Britain. The first to be demonstrated working was the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM or \"Baby\"), while the EDSAC, completed a year after SSEM, was the first practical implementation of the stored program design. Shortly thereafter, the machine originally described by von Neumann's paper\u2014EDVAC\u2014was completed but did not see full-time use for an additional two years. Nearly all modern computers implement the stored-program architecture in some form. It has become the main concept which defines a modern computer. Most of the technologies used to build computers have changed since the 1940s, but many current computers still use the von-Neumann architecture. Computers that used vacuum tubes as their electronic elements were in use throughout the 1950s. Vacuum tube electronics were largely replaced in the 1960s by transistor-based electronics, which are smaller, faster and cheaper to produce. They also need less power and are more reliable than vacuum tubes. In the 1970s, technologies were based on integrated circuits. Microprocessors, such as the Intel 4004, further decreased size and cost. They also made computers faster and more reliable. By the 1980s, computers became sufficiently small and cheap to replace simple mechanical controls in domestic appliances such as washing machines. The 1980s also saw home computers and the now ubiquitous personal computer. With the evolution of the Internet, personal computers are becoming as common as the television and the telephone in the household. In 2005 Nokia started to call its top-line smartphones of the N-series \"multimedia computers\" and after the launch of the Apple iPhone in 2007, many are now starting to add the smartphone category among \"real\" computers. In 2008, if the category of smartphones are included in the numbers of computers in the world, the biggest computer maker by units sold, is no longer Hewlett-Packard, but rather Nokia. Kinds of computers. A \"desktop computer\" is a small machine which is usually accompanied by a screen (which isn't part of the computer) and used at a household. \"Laptop computers\" are portable computers that are commonly used for work or personal media purposes. Both laptops and desktops are considered personal computers. \"Mainframes\" are large computers used for managing businesses or hosting servers. \"Embedded computers\" are computer systems that cannot be programmed by the user because they are preprogrammed for a specific task and are buried within the equipment they serve. For example, in mobile phones, Automatic Teller Machines, Microwave ovens, CD Players and Cars. How computers work. Computers store data and the instructions telling them what to do with the data as numbers, because computers can do things with numbers very quickly. These data are stored as binary symbols (1s and 0s). A 1 or a 0 symbol stored by a computer is called a bit, which comes from the words binary digit. Computers can use many bits together to represent instructions and the data that these instructions use. A list of these instructions is called a program and stored on the computer's hard disk. Computers use \"memory\" called \"RAM\" as a space to carry out the instructions and store data while it is doing these instructions. When the computer wants to store the results of the instructions for later, it uses the hard disk. An operating system tells the computer how to understand what jobs it has to do, how to do these jobs, and how to tell people the results. It tells the electronics inside the computer, or \"hardware\", how to work to get the results it needs. This lets most computers have the same operating system, or list of orders to tell it how to talk to the user, while each computer can have its own computer programs or list of jobs to do what its user needs. Having different programs and operating systems makes it easy to learn how to use computers for new things. When a user needs to use a computer for something different, the user can learn how to use a new program. Computers and the Internet. One of the most important jobs that computers do for people is helping with communication. Communication is how people share information. Computers have helped people move forward in science, medicine, business, and learning, because they let experts from anywhere in the world work with each other and share information. They also let other people communicate with each other, do their jobs almost anywhere, learn about almost anything, or share their opinions with each other. The Internet is the thing that lets people communicate between their computers. Blogs are used by many people to say what they want on the Internet. Some people spend most of their time reading and writing blogs. Many people from all over the world use them. Some people use them to write about things that happen to them. Experts can use them to help people learn more. Some blogs are used by companies to sell things. Computers and waste. A computer is now almost always an electronic device. It usually contains materials that will become toxic waste when disposed of. When a new computer is bought in some places, laws require that the cost of its waste management must also be paid for. This is called product stewardship. Computers can become obsolete quickly, depending on what programs the user runs. Very often, they are thrown away within two or three years, because newer programs require a more powerful computer. This makes the problem worse, so computer recycling happens a lot. Many projects try to send working computers to developing nations so they can be re-used and will not become waste as quickly, as most people do not need to run new programs. The main hardware in a computer. Computers come different forms, but most of them have a common architecture. A computer has several main parts. When comparing a computer to a human body, the CPU is like a brain. It does most of the 'thinking' and tells the rest of the computer how to work. The CPU is on the Motherboard, which is like the skeleton. It provides the basis for where the other parts go, and carries the nerves that connect them to each other and the CPU. The motherboard is connected to a power supply, which provides electricity to the entire computer. The various drives (CD drive, floppy drive, and on many newer computers, USB drive) act like eyes, ears, and fingers, and allow the computer to read different types of storage, in the same way that a human can read different types of books. The hard drive is like a human's memory, and keeps track of all the data stored on the computer. Most computers have a sound card or another method of making sound, which is like vocal cords, or a voice box. Connected to the sound card are speakers, which are like a mouth, and are where the sound comes out. Computers might also have a graphics card, which helps the computer to create visual effects, such as 3D environments, or more realistic colors, and more powerful graphics cards can make more realistic or more advanced images, in the same way a well trained artist can.",
   "Continent": "A continent is a large area of the land on Earth that is joined together. People do not agree about how many continents there are. In general it is agreed there are seven continents. Oceania is a region which includes Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. Some say that Oceania is not a continent but it is often treated like one. Other groups believe that it is a continent and that Australia is just a part of this continent and not its own continent. Some say that North America and South America are one continent. Some say that Europe and Asia are only parts of a continent called Eurasia. Some even say that Eurasia and Africa are one continent called Eurafrasia. When British people talk about \"the Continent\" (or \"Continental\") they mean the European mainland. This meaning is not used as much as it used to be, but is still seen in phrases like \"Continental breakfast\" (rolls with cheese, jam etc as distinct from an \"English breakfast\" which is a cooked breakfast).",
   "Country": "In geography, a country is a political division. It is often a sovereign territory. The term is most commonly associated with both state and nation, and also with government. For example, the United States of America is a country.",
   "Colchester": "Colchester is a town in the northern part of the English county of Essex. It has a population of 104,000 people. People believe that Colchester is oldest Roman town that that is known in England. History. Before Roman times, Colchester was \"Camulodunon\". This is a Celtic name that came from Camulos. Camulos was the Celtic god of war. The Romans called Colchester \"Camulodunum\" (written \"CAMVLODVNVM\"). Colchester was attacked and burnt by Boudicca in 61 AD. The church at the Benedictine abbey of Saint John the Baptist was destroyed in 1539. This was when King Henry VIII took the property of the Roman Catholic institutions in England. The only part left is a gate that people still go to visit. King Cunobelinus (or \"Cunobelin\") was from Colchester.",
   "Cartography": "Cartography is making maps. Cartography is part of geography. How people make maps is always changing. In the past, maps were drawn by hand, but today most printed maps are made using computers. Making a map can be as simple as drawing a direction on a napkin, or as complicated as showing a census of a whole country. Anyone can make a map, but there are people who spend their lives learning how to make complicated maps. Cartographers in the media. Various cartographers appear in the media, notably Wally the Cartographer from Monkey Island.",
   "Creative network": "A creative network is a loose group of people creating something in art or science or business. It is never larger than about a dozen people who may move from one project to another as a troupe or team. They have only a few goals at a time, and never more than one major goal. Each person plays a tightly or loosely defined role in the network. For instance to make a movie a writer, director, producer and actors are needed. There may also be a need for a costumer, a cameraman (if the director cannot do it all), an audio engineer, and a film editor if the project is big enough and the schedule tight enough. Very often the roles and timing are determined by a power network (say the bank or studio that funds the project). However, the creative control remains within the small creative network.",
   "Chorizo": "Chorizo is a pork (pig-meat) sausage which people first made in Spain. In it there is fatty pork in large pieces, with chili pepper and paprika. The special taste of this sausage comes from the mild Spanish paprika in it. In the western hemisphere, people know the Mexican and Caribbean sorts better. In these sorts of chorizo, the pork is in much smaller pieces. Different seasonings are also in it with the chili. People eat chorizo without cooking it, or they fry it in oil. People also use it as a part of other dishes, the same way they eat breakfast sausage. It can also be used in place of ground beef or pork.",
   "Catharism": "The Cathar faith was a version of Christianity. It was wiped out by the Roman Catholic Church in the 13th century by a Crusade. They were usually considered Gnostics. The word 'Cathar' comes the Greek word \"katharos\" meaning 'unpolluted' (from Tobias Churton, \"The Gnostics\") or \"the pure ones\". Principles. The Cathars believed that the world had been made by a bad god. The believed that this bad god had taken them from the good god put them the world but inside their bodies there was a spirit and that spirit needed to return to the good god. They were famous for a belief in a form of reincarnation and believed that when someone died the bad god would put that persons spirit in a new body. They believed this cycle of coming back to life could be escaped by a ritual cleansing. They were opposed to the doctrine of sin. Women were prominent in the faith. They were pacifists. They were vegetarians. They preached tolerance of other faiths. They rejected the usual Christian doctrine of marriage. An earlier 10th century Bulgarian heresy, Bogomilism, started some of these trends. Language. They used a bible in the language people spoke. Many other Christians used a Bible in Latin. Latin was spoken only by the priests. Problems. In 1145 open challenge to Catholic dominance began. In about 1165 the first Cathars said that the Church was \"full of ravening wolves and hypocrites\" and \"worshipping the wrong God\", right in front of the most powerful Catholics. In 1166 the Council of Oxford in England wiped out the English Cathars. It was also suppressed in Northern France. In 1167 Cathar bishops met to discuss organizing a counter Church - in the South of France, the Langedoc nobles protected it, and many noble women became \"Perfects\". Parish clergy had low morale. Reactions. All this was unpopular with the Roman Catholic Church, whose Pope, the Bishop of Rome, had begun to say he was infallible from the 11th century onwards. The pope also started to hold total authority over what was called \"Christendom\". Pope Innocent III's control by 1198 was not yet firm. In the South of France there was tremendous religious fervor, and an economy that was starting to grow, and a social class of merchants and peasants was starting to grow. Peasants owned their own land. Meanwhile, in other parts of Europe, peasants were forced to give up their land to nobles and become serfs or slaves - the system of feudalism. There was a strong central absolute monarchy that did not exist in the South of France. The burghers and bankers had more power in this looser system. R. I. Moore is a historian who believes that it was desire to crush this system and take over the land that drove the attack. However there was real cultural and religious difference to cause problems: Troubadors, who combined some of the traditions of the Bards of the Celts, and Jews, were both part of the multicultural society in the South of France. Their influences were not appreciated by local or Roman Church figures. The 12th century Roman Catholic Monks were founding their monasteries outside the towns, drawing the best people there. Results. The Cathars thus had little competition. The Cathar \"Perfects\", the so-called Good Men or Good Women, lived austere lives and spread their faith in towns - where the Catholics in general did not have their best agents. Also, Cathars preached that only these Good leaders had to follow the regimens their whole lives - lay people could repent only on their deathbeds. Many 20th century Christian sects have similar beliefs. Today Cathars would not be considered heretics. Methods. The Pope ordered a crusade against the Cathars in southern France. He said any crusader who answered the call would be given the same rewards as a crusader who went to the Holy Land. This was an absolution of all sin, a forgiveness of all debts, and all the pillaging and raping they could want. At Launguedoc, in July 1209, a force of about 30,000 Crusaders arrived at the walls of Beziers, and demanded that about 200 Cathars be surrendered. The people of the town who were mostly Catholic, said that rather than turn over their friends and kin, \"we would rather be flayed alive.\" A mistake by the defenders of Beziers let thousands of attackers in. Arnaud Amaury, the Pope's official in charge of the crusade, supposedly said the famous phrase: 'Kill them all, God will know his own'. Everyone in the town was massacred, some while taking refuge in the church. It is guessed that 20,000 were killed, many of whom were Catholics and not Cathars at all. The crusade became known as the Albigensian crusade after the town of Albi. It was to wipe out the Cathars entirely over forty or so years. The Crusaders wanted to go home, but were ordered by the Pope to continue until the whole South of France was controlled and all Cathars were dead. In 1210 they attacked the fortress at Minerv and built \"the first great bonfire of heretics\" - beginning the practice of burning at the stake that would continue in the Inquisition of the Counter-Reformation. Results. The Albigensian crusade actually failed to destroy the Cathar beliefs from southern France. This would happen by a different sort of crusade, one that turned neighbor against neighbor and brother against brother. The shadow of the Inquisition fell over the south of France. In 1233, Pope Gregory IX sent Dominican monks to the Languedoc. They set up an office of the Inquisition and sent out notices that anyone who came and confessed would be forgiven. People became terrified that their neighbors had said something about them, so they went and turned in their neighbors first. It eventually got to the point where people were turning in the dead and corpses were dug up, burned and the property they had left their heirs was taken away by the Roman Catholic Church. A lot of this crusade was not so much about faith, at least not for the church, but money. If someone were turned in as a heretic, his property was taken by the church. In the end the Inquisition did wipe out most of the Cathars though it took well over a hundred years to get all of them. The last known Cathar follower was burned at the stake in the early 1300's. Every last Cathar \"Perfect\" was burned at the stake. At least those the Roman Catholic Church could find.",
   "City": "A city is a place where many people live together. A city has many buildings and streets. It has houses or apartments for many people to live, shops where they may buy things, places for people to work and a government organisation to run the city, and to keep law and order in the city. Many people live in cities because it is easy for them to find and do the things they want there. A city usually has a \"city centre\" where government and business take place, and places called suburbs where people live around the outside of the centre. What makes a city? There is no rule that is used all over the world to decide why some places are called \"city\" and other places are called \"town\". In American English, people often call all places cities. (See below: Size of cities) Size of cities. The sizes of cities can be very different. This depends on the type of city it is. Cities that were built hundreds of years ago and which have not changed much, are very much smaller than modern cities. There are two main reasons. One is because old cities often have a city wall, and most of the city is inside it. Another important reason is because the streets in old cities are often narrow. If the city got too big, it was hard for a cart carrying food to get to the market place. People in cities need food, and the food always has to come from outside the city. Cities that were on a river like London could grow much bigger than cities that were on a mountain like Siena in Italy, because the river made a transport route for carrying food and other goods, as well as for transporting people. London has been changing continually for hundreds of years, while Siena, which was a very important city in the 1300s has changed very little in 700 years. Modern cities with modern transport systems can grow very large, because the streets are wide enough for cars, buses and trucks, and there are often railway lines as well. In the US, the word city is often used for towns that are not very big. When the first European people went to America, they gave the name \"city\" to new places. They hoped the places would be great cities in the future. For example, Salt Lake City was the name given to a village of 148 people. When they started building the town they made street plans and called it Great Salt Lake City (for the nearby Great Salt Lake). Now, 150 years later, it really is a big city. In modern times many cities have grown bigger and bigger. The whole area is often called a \"metropolis\" and can sometimes includes several small ancient towns and villages. The \"metropolis\" of London includes the City of London, the City of Westminster and many old villages such as Notting Hill, Southwark, Richmond and Greenwich. The part that is officially known as the \"City of London\" only takes up one square mile. (See the picture) The rest is known as \"Greater London\". Many other cities have grown in the same way. These giant cities can be exciting places to live, and many people can find good jobs there, but modern cities also have many problems. Many people cannot find jobs in the cities and have to get money by begging or by crime. Cars, factories, and garbage create a lot of pollution that makes people sick. History. The first cities were made in ancient times, as soon as people began to create civilization. Famous ancient cities which fell to ruins included Babylon, Troy, Mycenae and Mohenjo Daro. Benares in northern India is one among the ancient cities which has a history of more 3000 years. Other cities that have existed since ancient times are Athens in Greece, Rome and Volterra in Italy, Alexandria in Egypt and York in England. In Europe, in the Middle Ages, being a city was a special privilege, granted by nobility. Cities that fall into this category, usually had (or still have) city walls. The people who lived in the city were privileged over those who did not. Medieval cities that still have walls include Carcassonne in France, Toledo in Spain and Canterbury in England. In the United Kingdom, a city is a town which people have always called a city, or which has got the name \"city\" status by royal charter (a special paper from the king or queen). Cities usually get this because they have a special number of people or are important. In the past, cities got that name if they had a cathedral or a university. Some cathedral cities, for example St David's, are small, and people do not normally think of them as cities. Cities that became cities because of their university generally grow because more people move there to be educated at the university colleges. The university cities of Oxford and Cambridge are famous throughout the world. In modern Europe, any town with at least 10,000 people in it can call itself city. Many cities that have their status from the Middle Ages are actually smaller than 10,000 people.",

   "Maize": "Maize (called corn is some countries) is a member of the grass family \"Poaceae\". It is a cereal grain that was first grown by people in ancient Central America. It is now the third most important cereal crop in the world. It is used as a food staple by many people in Mexico, Central and South America and parts of Africa. In Europe and the rest of North America, maize is grown mostly for use as animal feed. In Canada and the United States, maize is commonly referred to as \"corn.\"",
   "Civics": "Civics is the study of government. Since a city has the most unsimple government problems, the word for this study is like that for city.",
   "Calculus": "Calculus is the part of mathematics which looks at things that change over time. It tries to say what type of change it is and how big it is using functions at the exact moment at which the change is taking place. There are two different types of calculus. Differential calculus divides things into small pieces and tells us how they change from one moment to the next, while integral calculus joins the small pieces together and tells us how much of something is made by a change. It is used in a lot of different fields such as physics, astronomy, biology, engineering, economics, medicine and sociology. History. In the 1670s and 1680s, Sir Isaac Newton in England and Gottfried Leibniz in Germany developed calculus at the same time, working separately from each other. Newton wanted to design a system to predict the positions of the planets in the sky, because astronomy has always been a popular and useful form of science, and knowing more about the motions of the objects in the night sky was important for navigation of ships. Leibniz wanted to work out the area under a curve (a line which is not straight). Many years later, the two men argued over who discovered it first. Scientists from England supported Newton, but scientists from continental Europe supported Leibniz. Most mathematicians today, however, agree that both men share the credit equally. Some parts of modern calculus come from Newton, such as its uses in physics. Other parts come from Leibniz, such as the symbols used to write it. They were not the first people to use mathematics to describe the physical world\u2014Aristotle and Pythagoras came earlier, as did Galileo who said that mathematics was the language of science. But they were the first to design a system that describes how things change over time and can predict how they will change in the future. The name \"calculus\" was the Latin word for a small stone the ancient Romans used in counting and gambling. The English word \"calculate\" comes from the same Latin word. Differential calculus. Differential calculus is the process of finding out the rate of change of a variable compared to another variable. It can be used to find the speed of a moving object, the slope of a curve, figuring out the maximum or minimum points of a curve or to find answers to problems in the electricity and magnetism areas of physics, and many other uses. Many amounts can be variables, which can change their value unlike numbers such as 5 or 200. Some examples of variables are distance and time. The speed of an object is how far it travels in a particular time. So if a town is 80 kilometres (50 miles) away and a person in a car gets there in one hour, they have travelled at an average speed of 80 kilometres (50 miles) per hour. But this is only an average\u2014they may have been travelling faster at some times (on a highway) and slower at others (at a traffic light or on a small street where people live). Imagine a driver trying to figure out a car's speed using only its odometer (distance meter) and clock, without a speedometer! Until calculus was invented, the only way to work this out was to cut the time into smaller and smaller pieces, so the average speed over the smaller time would get closer and closer to the actual speed at a point in time. This was a very long and hard process and had to be done each time people wanted to work something out. A very similar problem is to find the slope (how steep it is) at any point on a curve. The slope of a \"straight\" line is easy to work out\u2014it is simply how much it goes up (\"y\" or vertical) divided by how much it goes across (\"x\" or horizontal). On a \"curve\", though, the slope is a variable (has different values at different points) because the line bends. But if the curve was to be cut into very, very small pieces, the curve at the point would look almost like a very short straight line. So to work out its slope, a straight line can be drawn through the point with the same slope as the curve at that point. If it is done exactly right, the straight line will have the same slope as the curve, and is called a tangent. But there is no way to know (without very complicated mathematics) whether the tangent is exactly right, and our eyes are not accurate enough to be certain whether it is exact or simply very close. What Newton and Leibniz found was a way to work out the slope (or the speed in the distance example) exactly using simple and logical rules. They divided the curve into an infinite number of very small pieces. They then chose points on either side of the point they were interested in and worked out tangents at each. As the points moved closer together towards the point they were interested in, the slope \"approached\" a particular value as the tangents approached the real slope of the curve. They said that this particular value it approached was the actual slope. Let's say we have a function \"y\" = f(\"x\"). f is short for function, so this equation means \"y is a function of x\". This tells us that how high y is on the vertical axis depends on what x (the horizontal axis) is at that time. For example with the equation \"y\" = \"x\"\u00b2, we know that if \"x\" is 1, then \"y\" will be 1; if \"x\" is 3, then \"y\" will be 9; if \"x\" is 20, then \"y\" will be 400. formula_1 If we use y = x\u00b2, the derivative produced using this method is 2\"x\", or 2 multiplied by \"x\". So we know without having to draw any tangent lines that at any point on the curve \"f(x)\" = \"x\"\u00b2, the derivative \"f'(x)\" (marked with an apostrophe) will be 2\"x\" at any point. This process of working out a slope using limits is called differentiation, or finding the derivative. formula_2 Mathematicians have grown this basic theory to make simple algebra rules which can be used to find the derivative of almost any function. Main idea of calculus. The main idea in calculus is called the \"Fundamental Theorem of Calculus\". This main idea is that the two calculus processes, differential and integral calculus, are opposites. That is, a person can use differential calculus to undo an integral calculus process. Also, a person can use integral calculus to undo a differential calculus method, just like if you add a number to another number you can 'undo' it by taking away that number. How to use integral calculus to find areas. The method integral calculus uses to find areas of shapes is to break the shape up into many small boxes, and add up the area of each of the boxes. This gives an approximation to the area. If the boxes are made narrower and narrower, then there are more and more of them, and the area of all the boxes becomes very close to the area of the shape. One of the main ideas of calculus is that we can imagine having an infinite number of these boxes, each infinitely narrow, and then we would have the exact area of the shape. Other uses of calculus. Calculus is used to describe things that change such as Nature. Calculus can be used to show how waves move. Waves are very important in the natural world. For example, sound and light can be thought of as waves. Calculus can be used to show how heat moves. Calculus can be used to show how very small things like atoms act. Calculus can be used to learn how fast something will fall. Calculus can be used to learn the path of the moon as it moves around the earth. Calculus can be used to find the path of the earth as it moves around the sun.",
   "Coin": "A coin is normally a round piece of metal that is used as currency. Coins have been made for about 2600 years; the first place to make coins was Lydia (modern Turkey). Appearance. Many coins have complex decorations; one side often has the picture of a head on it. Most people use coins as currency. Uses. The different decorations on each side of a coin might be used to decide things randomly. This is called \"tossing a coin\". A person can throw the coin into the air and catch it. You then look at which picture is facing up. If the head is facing up it is called \"heads\", if the other picture is facing up it is called \"tails\". Before tossing the coin someone has to decide what each picture means. Gambling. Tossing a coin can be a type of gambling, which is illegal (against the law) in some countries, but it depends, of course, if something is gambled upon with a price someone risks or if it's just merely to decide something, so it's hard to take a real gamble with coins. Other views. Some people see coins as a sign as greed, such as some Communists and Puritans, who sometimes condemn over-hoarding of coins, and ascetics, who often keep little in the ways of money (coins), leading a \"poor\"-lifestyle. Collecting. Because coins have been made for a very long time, some people collect old coins. They are much cheaper than other old things, especially if they are made of cheap metals like copper. Older coins normally cost more than newer ones, but rarity matters more-some coins from the 1920s cost vast sums, while some Roman coins cost very little.",
   "Conceptual metaphor": "A conceptual metaphor is a metaphor that is used very often without being stated clearly. It is often implied in many idioms.

   "Crust": "The crust of a piece of bread is the edge where it is harder and darker.",
   "Comedy": "A comedy is a kind of play (acting in a theater), television show or a movie that is funny, silly, or that makes people laugh. Comedies may also show people telling jokes and funny stories. People who are known for acting in comedies are comedians. History. Comedy plays have been around for thousands of years. The ancient Greeks had comedy plays. Many comedy plays were written in the 1500s by the British writer William Shakespeare. Shakespeare's comedy plays include:\" All\u2019s Well That Ends Well, The Comedy of Errors, A Midsummer Nights Dream\", and \"Twelfth Night\". Sandre Comedy. There are different types of comedy. One type of comedy is called \"slap stick comedy.\" In \"slap stick comedy,\" people just do silly things such as tripping, falling over or embarrassing themselves just to make people laugh. Slap stick comedy can be used in comedy movies or comedy television shows. Slap stick comedy was used a lot in silent (no sound) movies from the 1920s. A comedian who acted in the silent movies who used a lot of slapstick comedy was Charlie Chaplin. In the 1950s and 1960s, the comedian Jerry Lewis also used silly slap stick comedy in his comedy movies. Stand-up comedy. Another type of comedy is \"stand-up comedy.\" In \"stand-up comedy\", a comedian (person who tries to make people laugh) stands up in front of a crowd and tells jokes and silly stories. Some comedians, such as Jerry Seinfeld, work as stand-up comedians as a job (way to make money). Other comedians do stand-up comedy in nightclubs (bars where adults drink alcohol and relax) as a hobby (activity that a person does for fun). Comedy movies. Comedy movies are very popular type of movie. Some comedy movies have \"slapstick comedy,\" in which people just do silly things such as tripping, falling over or embarrassing themselves just to make people laugh. Other comedy movies show funny stories or situations in which people are behaving in a silly manner. Some comedies make the audience laugh by showing strange or unusual images or situations that do not make sense. Different types of comedy movies. Some types of comedy movies mix comedy with other types of movies. *There is a type of movie called a dramedy, which is a mix of a drama movie and a comedy movie. Comedy television shows. Comedy shows are very popular on television. Comedy shows on television are often called \"sitcoms.\" The word \"sitcom\" is a shortened way of saying \"situational comedy.\" Television situational comedies usually show characters who do silly or funny things which make the audience laugh.",
   "Comet": "A comet is a ball of mostly ice that moves around in outer space. It is similar to an asteroid. In Earth's solar system, the orbits of comets go farther than Pluto, a dwarf planet that used to be the farthest planet from the Sun. Most are very far away from the Sun, but some come near enough to Earth for us to see at night. They have long \"tails\", because the Sun melts the ice. Sometimes people call them \"dirty snowballs\" or \"shooting stars\". The hard centre of the comet is the \"nucleus\". It is one of the blackest things in the solar system. When light shone on Comet Halley's nucleus, only 4% of the light shone back to us. \"Periodic\" comets visit again and again. \"Non-periodic\" or \"single-apparition\" comets visit only once. People have seen some comets when they broke into pieces: Comet Biela was one example. Another comet was seen when it hit a planet: Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 hit Jupiter in 1994. Some comets orbit (go around) together in groups. Astronomers think these comets are broken pieces that used to be one object. History of comets. In old times, people used to be scared of comets. They didn't know what they were, or where they came from. Some thought that they were fireballs sent from demons or gods to destroy the earth. They said that each time a comet appeared, it would bring bad luck with it. Whenever a comet appeared, a king would die. One of these examples is shown in the Bayeux Tapestry, when Halley's Comet returned. Comets were also known to end wars and thought to bring famine. It was not until the Renaissance when scientists started to look at comets with less superstition and base their observations on science. Tycho Brahe reasoned that comets did not come from the earth, and his calculations showed that comets must be six times further than the earth is from the moon. Edmond Halley (whom Halley's Comet is named after) reasoned that comets are periodic, that is, they appear once every several hundreds of years. This led to the first prediction of a comet's return, Halley's Comet. In honor of this prediction, Halley's Comet was named. Issac Newton also studied comets, but he thought that comets were do to \"vapours rising from the soil\". In other words, he thought that gasses came up from the ground to form comets. Newton later said that comets make U-turns around the sun. He asked Edmond Halley to publish the research in his book \"Philosophiae Natrualis Principia Mathematica\". Before Newton said this, people believed that comets go in to the sun, then another comes out from behind the sun. All this new information and research gave people confidence, but some still thought that comets were messengers from the gods. One 18th century vision said that comets were the places that hell was, where souls would ride, being burned up by the heat of the sun and frozen by the cold of space. Although today we know a lot about comets, there will always be people who will be afraid when a comet returns.",

   "Dublin": "Dublin is the capital city of the Republic of Ireland. The Greater Dublin Area has a population of over 1.6 million people. Dublin is also the biggest city on the island of Ireland. Dublin was built by the Vikings and is built upon the river Liffey. Many famous writers lived in Dublin. Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw were born in Dublin. James Joyce is probably Dublin's best known and most international writer.",
   "Dance": "Dance is when people move their body to music. There are many kinds of dance, like jazz, ballet, tap, waltz, hip hop,bollywood,irish and slow dancing and many many others Dancing is done for fun. Dance is an art. Dance can be done by one person or two people or many people. Dancing is usually done while music is playing. Some people dance to express their feelings and emotions. Other people dance to feel better. Someone who makes a dance, is called a choreographer or \"dance writer\". History. The first dance school was opened in 1661 in Paris, France. Only men were accepted until 1681. After 1681, women were accepted too. Ballroom dances are forms of modern dance. Ballroom dances such as the waltz are done with two people. People who want to learn to dance can go to dance schools. Dance schools teach dance movements. It takes many years of practice to become an experienced and flexible dancer. Dance can be used as a form of communication between humans or humans and animals, it is a way of becoming an object or it is musical, mythological or a funny piece of work. Classical ballet (say 'bal-ay'), tap, folk, dance gymnastics, figure skating and synchronised swimming are types of dance. 'Swan Lake' has been shown to the public using ballet. To make (or choreograph) a dance, it is good to count the movement. Usually, two moves will last until the numbers '1, 2, 3, 4' or '1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8' or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.",
   "Deadline": "A deadline is a time by which some task must be completed. Very often, it means a time limit that is set in place by an authority - for example, a teacher tells students that they must turn in their homework in by a certain time. This is so the teacher is able to report fairly to his or her principal that every student had the same chance to do the work. Deadlines may also be set by a time horizon that comes from something that is not a human authority, but part of nature. For example, by sunset one must do those tasks requiring daylight. However, a human must watch the sun and decide what light is strong enough to still be daylight, so time limits will still be involved even if one observes a horizon and sets a deadline oneself. A way to remember this is that a time horizon is like the physical horizon where sunset happens and a time limit is a thing people set up to deal with this. A deadline is a thing powerful people set up to ensure less powerful people comply with their way of doing things.",
   "Dutton's Speedwords": "Dutton Speedwords is an auxiliary language. It can be used by people who speak any other language. Auxiliary means it is a helper for other languages. It is not a whole language by itself. It is also a shorthand writing system \u2013 this means you can use it to write quickly. The method was made up by Reginald John Garfield Dutton (1886-1970) in 1922. It was first published in 1935. It was called \"International Symbolic Script\". A year later, it was called \"Speedwords\". It was changed in 1946 and 1951. It has two uses; to be a language and to be used for writing quickly. Dutton hoped that this would mean more people would learn it because they could use it for two reasons. The books that Dutton wrote about Speedwords are not printed anymore. But Speedwords is now being used by more people because they find it is good for working online. For example, it makes it faster to type an email. Another way of writing quickly is Pitman's shorthand. This uses special symbols instead of letters. Speedwords uses Roman letters. This makes it easier to learn. It also means it can be typed using a normal keyboard. Each word means only one thing. This means you do not need to use different forms of the same word. The words used in Speedwords are the same as the words used in many other languages. The words are like short versions of the writer's own language.",
   "Division": "Division is an arithmetic operation used to find out how many times a number will go into another number. For example, two goes into nine, four and a half times. This can also be written down as 9 \u00f7 2 = 4.5, or formula_1 or spoken verbally as \"nine over two is four and a half.\" The numbers in the operation have special names: Dividend \u00f7 divisor = quotient. Other meanings. In a \"business organization\", a division is a unique group of people who are responsible for a particular product or function. In \"military doctrine\", a division is a unique cohesive unit. In the United States a division totals about 10,000 to 12,000 soldiers or marines.",
   "Dimension": "A dimension is a measure of the size of something. For example, the three dimensions that give the size of an object in the world are Dimensions can be used to measure position too. The distance to a position from a starting place can be measured in the length, width and height directions. These distances are a measure of the position. Sometimes a fourth dimension, time, is used to show the position of an event in time and space. Other Dimensions. In modern science, people use other dimensions. Dimensions like temperature and weight can be used to show the position of something in less simple spaces. Dimensions in mathematics. Mathematicians also use dimensions. In mathematics, dimensions are more general. Dimensions in mathematics might not measure things in the world. The rules for doing arithmetic with dimensions in mathematics might be different than usual arithmetic rules. Dimensions and vectors. Vectors are used to show distances and directions. Vectors are often used in engineering and science, and sometimes in mathematics. A vector is a list of numbers. There is one number for each dimension. There are arithmetic rules for vectors.",
   "Distance": "Distance is how far one thing is from another thing. Distance is a measure of the space between two things. Displacement. Distance is different from displacement. Displacement is the difference between a starting point and a finishing point. Example of Displacement. A and B are 1 metre apart. Tom walks from A to B. Then Tom walks from B back to A. The distance Tom walked is 2 metres. Tom's displacement is 0 metres, because Tom started at A and finished at A.",
   "Dictionary": "A dictionary is a book which explains the meanings of words. The words are arranged in alphabetical order so that they can be found quickly. The word \u201cdictionary\u201d comes from the Latin \u201cdiction\u201d (\u201cword\u201d). There are several types of dictionaries: dictionaries which explain words and how they are used, dictionaries which translate words from one language to another, dictionaries of biography which tell about famous people, technical dictionaries which explain the meanings of technical words or words connected to a particular subject (sometimes called a thesaurus). Some of these come close to being an encyclopedia, but an encyclopedia gives a lot of extra information about things (knowledge) and does not explain the use of the language. Dictionaries which explain the meaning of words. Dictionaries which explain what words mean will give a clear \u201cdefinition\u201d of the word (e.g. \"hippopotamus\": a hoofed mammal with thick skin, large mouth and short legs that lives in rivers and lakes of Africa.) Good dictionaries will also give more information about the word. It will explain how it is pronounced. Usually the International Phonetic Alphabet is used for this. It will explain how the word is used. This is not a problem for a word like \u201chippopotamus\u201d, but a word like \u201cput\u201d has so many different meanings that a large dictionary may have a whole page or more to explain how it can be used. It will also explain what language the word comes from (e.g. Greek \u201chippos\u201d horse and \u201cpotamus\u201d river). A dictionary may also give the form of the word in different tenses, plural form etc. Dictionaries which translate into foreign languages. There are also dictionaries which translate words into foreign languages. Very often one volume (one book) will translate both ways, so half the book will be translating from English to Dutch and the other half from Dutch to English. When using a dictionary to find out how to say something in another language one has to be careful to choose the right word. A word like \u201cright\u201d has two basic meanings in English: 1) \u201ccorrect\u201d, and 2) the opposite of \u201cleft\u201d. Other languages are not like English: they will have different words for these different meanings. A word like \u201cput\u201d has many meanings. A good dictionary will have a large list of these meanings to help people find the word they want. In many languages, for example, the word \u201cput\u201d will be different according to whether something is being put onto something (e.g. a table) or into something (e.g. a cupboard). Updating dictionaries. Dictionaries need to be updated frequently because of the way language changes. New words are often brought into a language (e.g. lots of computer terms) or words change their meanings (e.g. \u201cgay\u201d or \u201ccool\u201d). The most famous English Dictionary is the Oxford English Dictionary (or OED). Words are always being added to the OED, they are never taken out even if they are obsolete (not used any more). The OED can be accessed online (with a subscription).",
   "Denmark": "Denmark is a country in northern Europe. 5,400,000 people live there. There are many islands, but there are no mountains. Denmark is on the North Sea. Denmark is a kingdom. The capital of Denmark is Copenhagen. In geography, \"Denmark\" is the land in northern Europe, where the Danes live. In the political sense, \"Denmark\" also includes the Faroe Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, and Greenland in North America. All three parts of the country have different languages and culture. In 2006 and 2007, surveys ranked Denmark as \"the happiest place in the world,\" based on standards of health, welfare, and education. Geography. Denmark is the smallest of the Scandinavian countries. The neighbours are Germany (to the south), Sweden (to the east), Norway (to the north) and the United Kingdom (to the west). The country is surrounded by the sea except for Jutland, the largest part of Denmark. It is connected to Germany by land. To the south-east there is the Baltic Sea, to the west the North Sea, to the north the Skagerrak and to the north-east the Kattegat. The western part of Denmark is the peninsula of Jutland (pronounced \"yut-land\"), bordering Germany. This is the only part of Denmark that is not an island. The rest of Denmark includes 76 islands people live on, and many tiny islands. To the east is the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea, the only place in Denmark where the bedrock can be seen. The country is quite flat. There are many small hills, lakes, creeks, forests and farmland. And nobody lives more than 60 km from the coast. Climate. The weather in Denmark is quite windy and rainy. In the winter, it does not get very cold; in most years, there are only a few weeks of snow. Every ten years or so, the sea around the islands freezes over, but in most winters, it does not. The climate and topography are not good for winter sports. Most summers are not very hot. People always dress to be ready for rain or wind. There are also very sunny times, but nobody can know ahead of time when these will be. The best time of the year for outdoor activities is the months of May and June until midsummer. People. The biggest part (91%) of Denmark's population of just under 5.5 million is of Danish descent. Of the rest 8.9% who are immigrants or descendent from recent immigrants, many come from South Asia or the Middle East. There are also small groups of Inuit from Greenland and Faroese. Language. The Danes speak Danish. Most Danes speak English, too. Many also speak German. On the Faroe Islands, Faroese is spoken, and people living in Greenland speak Inuit. In the southern part of Jutland, a German minority speaks German. The Danish language is much like Norwegian and Swedish. Regions and municipalities. Denmark is divided into five regions (Danish: \"regioner\", singular: \"region\"). The regions are \"Hovedstaden\", \"Midtjylland\", \"Nordjylland\", \"Sj\u00e6lland\", \"Syddanmark\" and a total of 98 municipalities (Danish: \"kommuner\"). Traffic. Because of the many islands, Denmark is a country of bridges. The main parts of the country, and most of the bigger islands, are connected by roads and railroads. One of the world's longest bridges connects the eastern and the western parts of the country, and there is a large bridge to Sweden also. There is still no bridge across the Baltic Sea to Germany, but it will most likely be built in a few years. The bridge to Sweden was expensive, took a long time to build, and required much planning by engineers. There are still many islands with no bridges to the mainland. People have to go by boat or airplane to reach these islands. Many islands will never be reached by bridges, because they are too small or too far away. If the island has too few people, bridges are often not built because it is expensive to build. Somebody has to pay for it, nothing is free. Culture. The people of Denmark have always depended on the sea. In earlier days, people could not travel anywhere unless they went by boat. Many Danes were fishermen or merchants. Even today, many Danes spend much time near or at the sea. Farming has always been one of the main occupations. Because of the climate and the soil, Denmark is a good place for agriculture. Export of food to the neighbouring countries is one of the most important sources of income for the country. Danish hams and cookies are exported throughout the world. Many Danes have become famous around the world, such as the scientist Ole R\u00f8mer, who discovered the speed of light, the philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, the author Hans Christian Andersen, the physicist Niels Bohr, and Lars Ulrich from Metallica. Danish food. The cuisine of Denmark is like the other Nordic countries (Finland, Norway, Iceland, and Sweden), as well as that of northern Germany, consists mainly pork meat and fish. Traditional Danish food includes \"frikadeller\" (fried meatballs, often served with potatoes and various sorts of gravy). Fish is also widely eaten, especially on the west coast of Jutland. Holidays. Christmas is the main feast of the year. Christmas is celebrated on the eve, December 24. In midwinter, a fast is celebrated. Children are dressed up, and go from house to house begging for candy. A barrel is smashed with clubs, and the person who hits the last stick is appointed king or queen of cats. Midsummer is celebrated with a huge bonfire in the evening of June 23. Most Danes have a three week summer holiday in July og August. Sports. The most popular sport in Denmark is football (soccer). Sailing and other water sports are also very popular, the same are sports indoor like badminton, handball and many others. King and Queen. Denmark does not currently have a King. The Queen is Margrethe II. Her husband is called a prince because he is the son-in-law, not the son, of the previous King. The royal couple have two children. In 2008 Prince Joachim have married for the second time. His new wife is from France and is called Marie.",
   "Diesel-electric": "A diesel-electric engine burns diesel or biodiesel fuel. However, rather than use this energy directly to run gears, it charges a battery which more efficiently turns wheels. Some designs also store braking energy in a flywheel, which can also charge a battery. However, these make the engine even more complex, and add weight to the vehicle, so are more appropriate for city driving where service stations are always available and there is much stop and go driving. Because they do not require any change or investment in stations nor much in vehicle design, diesel-electric vehicles are believed to be the most likely replacement for today's internal combustion engine. When properly tuned, they have low emissions and they use only about one-third of the fossil fuel of most gasoline engines powering similar vehicles. Honda and Toyota are presently delivering consumer priced diesel-electric cars. By contrast, hydrogen infrastructure is thought to be decades off, and is not fully implemented even in Iceland where there is abundant free geothermal electricity. Many activists feel that promoting hydrogen is a stall, a way to avoid forcing the shift to diesel-electric vehicles in the nearer term.",
   "Embassy": "A foreign embassy is the official office of one country in the capital of another country. It is where the ambassador (representative) of the home country works and it is where most of the communication (talk) between the two governments happens. Sometimes if a person lost his passport he/she can go to their own embassy.",
   "Europe": "Europe is a continent, the western part of Eurasia. It is separated from Asia by a traditional eastern boundary that includes the Ural Mountains in Russia and the Bosporus in Turkey, and from Africa by the Mediterranean Sea. The Atlantic Ocean is to the west of Europe. There are about 50 countries in Europe. The European Union is made up of some of the countries in Europe. Origin of Name. Europe is named after a person in Greek mythology called Europa. She was said to have been abducted to Crete by Zeus. The name later was used for Greece. Then as the rest of the area we call Europe started to have cities and empires the whole of the area West of the Urals got called this. Climate. In Europe there is different climate in different places like in the very north like Finland it stays snow in winter for 5-6 months and is -30 degrees celcius, however for instance in Spain it is warmer and hardly snows,except mountains. European Union. At this time, much of the continent shares some rulership in a body that is above any country, called the European Union.",
   "Encyclopedia": "An encyclopedia (or \"encyclop\u00e6dia\", \"cyclop\u00e6dia\") is a collection (usually a book) of information about things humans know. Word origin. The word \"encyclopedia\" is Latin and comes from Greek. The words \"\u03b5\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\", \"enkyklios paideia\" mean \"in a circle of teaching\". It is from \"\u03b5\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2\", \"in a circle\" from \"\u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2\" \"circle\" and \"\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\", meaning \"teaching\". The word \"\u03b5\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2\" can also mean \"general\": perhaps the people who made the Latin name \"encyclopedia\" did not understand the Greek word well. Perhaps the name should mean \"general teaching\". In Canada and the UK, and some other countries affected by the British Empire, encyclopedia is spelt mostly as \"encyclop\u00e6dia\". History. People have made encyclopedias for hundreds of years, but the name \"encyclopedia\" is from the 16th century. Types of encyclopedias. There are different types of encyclopedia. Some are general and have pages on lots of topics. The English language \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" and German \"Brockhaus\" are general encyclopedias. Some are about specific topics. For example, there are encyclopedias of medicine or philosophy. There are also some encyclopedias that have lots of topics with one point of view or one cultural bias. The \"Great Soviet Encyclopedia\" is one of these. Many dictionaries have a different sort of information as encyclopedias. Examples are the Dictionary of National Biography, the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, and Black's Law Dictionary. There are two main ways of organizing encyclopedias: from A to Z (the alphabetical way) or by categories. Most encyclopedias go from A to Z. There are also printed encyclopedias, and encyclopedias in the computer, such as Wikipedia, the largest computer encyclopedia. Encyclopedias. The largest encyclopedia is Wikipedia in English, which has more than 2 million articles now. The second largest, is the Encyclopaedia Britannica, which is the largest one that is printed. Stacy Schiff, a writer, says that Wikipedia is not as good as other encyclopedias because anyone can change it, so some people may write things that are wrong. Also, the way that Wikipedia works means that there is likely to be bias. On the other hand, Tyler Cowen, an Economist, says that other non-fiction writing may also have the same problems.",
   "Ethics": "Ideas about ethics. Some philosophers call ethics the \"science of morality\". \"Morality\" is what someone thinks or feels is good or bad. There are many different moralities, but they share some things. For example most people think that murder (killing somebody) is wrong. Some philosophers hope to find more things that moralities share. They think that ethics should use the scientific method to study things that people think are good or bad. Other philosophers think that ethics is separate from morality. They do not think that ethics can be studied using the scientific method and they think it is closer to metaphysics. Some of them think like platonists about what is good and bad. Other philosophers believe that ethics is subjective. This means that they think that what is right for me is whatever I say is right. This means that ethics is just a person's own morality. These philosophers do not think that ethics is the same for all people. What is ethics used for? Understanding ethics can help people decide what to do when they have choices. Many philosophers think that doing anything or making any choice is a part of ethics. Along with Aesthetics ethics forms part of axiology the philosophy of what people like.",
   "E Prime": "E Prime (it means English Prime) is a way of speaking English without using the verb \"to be\" in any way (\"be, is, am, are, was, were, been, and being\"). Instead, an E Prime speaker or writer uses different verbs like \"to become,\" \"to remain,\" and \"to equal\" or they might choose to rearrange the sentence to show that the \"thing\" does not actually \"act\". For example, in E Prime, a writer would change the statement \"Mistakes were made\" to \"Joe made mistakes.\" This change in wording reveals an actor (Joe) where the previous form concealed the actor. Users of E Prime would consider the changed sentence more accurate. What E Prime is. D. David Bourland, Jr. first suggested E Prime in 1965. Bourland had studied the discipline (way of thinking) of General Semantics. The main idea of General Semantics is that people can only know what they observe and experience when they see, hear, touch, taste, smell, think, and feel, and furthermore, that what they observe and experience can affect how they observe and experience in the future. Because each person has different experiences throughout their lives, they interpret their experiences differently. 1. That their experience of \"softness\" involves both the outside \"object\" called \"cat\" and the eyes, hands, brain and nervous system of the observer. 2. That someone else might experience different aspects of the cat. 3. That they themselves might experience something different at a different time or in different circumstances. (The cat might scratch them, or be wet or matted with dirt.) What E Prime is not. E Prime and General Semantics are not different languages or forms of English. Instead, they provide different ways of thinking and talking about the world. Although languages like Arabic, Turkish, and Cantonese do not have a separate verb for \"to be,\" they do have the idea of \"being.\" For example, an English speaker might say \"This apple is red.\" An Arabic speaker might say \"This apple red.\" Most languages can be used to express the idea of a red apple. An E Prime user chooses to only say that \"This apple looks red to me\" to remind themselves that \"seeing red\" involves both the apple and the eye and brain of the person looking at the apple. Many teachers of English encourage students to use verbs other than \"to be.\" To them, using other, more active verbs makes writing clearer and more interesting. These teachers want to improve their students' writing and may not agree with the ideas of General Semantics or E Prime.",
   "Einstein on the Beach": "\"Einstein on the Beach\" is an opera written by the minimalist composer Philip Glass and theater director and designer Robert Wilson. It was first acted for an audience in Avignon, France in 1976. It is a single act opera, approximately five hours long with no intermission. Given the minimalist (repetitive) nature of the music, audience members are free to enter and leave the opera as they wish.",
   "Ebola": "Ebola, pronounced E- Bo-la, is a \"hemorrhagic fever\" virus. (Hemorrhagic means causes very heavy bleeding.) It is a very deadly disease. 50-90% of people who get Ebola die. People who get infected with Ebola virus get the disease \"Ebola hemorrhagic fever\". How people get Ebola. In people, \"transmission\" (giving the virus to someone) happens because of touching fluids with the virus. People with Ebola hemorrhagic (bleeding) fever bleed very much. They have blood in diarrhea and vomit. They bleed from their noses, mouths, and genitals. These liquids are very infectious (they can make other people get the virus.) Symptoms of Ebola. When people get Ebola the first symptoms look like some other diseases. People get fever, feel very tired, have headache (pain in the head), pain in the stomach, pain in joints, and pain in the throat. Sometimes people think they have other diseases like malaria or typhoid fever. Later, people get much more sick. They have very bad bleeding. They get shock: low blood pressure, fast pulse (heart rate), and low blood circulation to the body. This causes organs to get very sick. The organs stop working. This is called \"organ failure\". Then, even if they make it to a hospital, \"most\" die. Ebola cannot be caught through the air. Treatment of Ebola. There is no special treatment for Ebola hemorrhagic fever. But if people get care from doctors and nurses more live. This is called supportive care. Supportive care can be fluids and blood given in people's veins. It can be medicines to make their blood pressure and blood circulation better. When people in a place get Ebola, it is called an \"outbreak\". If doctors see an outbreak is happening, they try to stop it. They stop it by isolating people with infection. This means keeping the blood and fluids from people with Ebola from touching other people. Then other people do not get the virus. When an outbreak happens, many people come to try and help stop it. The World Health Organization is the most important group that tries to stop Ebola outbreaks. Scientists are trying to find a vaccine for Ebola.",
   "Ecology": "Ecology is the science that studies the interactions of organisms with their environment and with one another. It comes from the Greek words \"oikos\" (habitat) and \"logos\" (study). It deals with energy relationships and tracing them to our sun, the source of energy used in photosynthesis. Ecology, biology and other Life Sciences overlap with zoology and geography, which describe the things that ecology tries to predict, and energy economics which describes mostly human food chains and trophic levels. Terrestrial ecoregion and climate change research are two areas where ecologists (people studying ecology) now focus. Ecology in politics. Ecology starts many powerful philosophical and political movements - including the conservation movement, wellness movement, environmental movement, and ecology movement we know today. When these are combined with peace movements and the Six Principles, they are called green movements. In general, these put ecosystem health first on a list of human moral and political priorities, as the way to achieve better human health and social harmony, and better economics. People with these beliefs are called political ecologists. Some have organized into the Green Parties, but there are actually political ecologists in most political parties. They very often use arguments from ecology to advance policy, especially forest policy and energy policy. Also, ecology means that it is the branch of biology dealing with the relations and interactions between organisms and their environment, including other organisms. Ecology includes economics. Ecological economics and human development theory try to separate the economic questions from others, but it is difficult. Many people think economics is just part of ecology now, and that economics that ignores it is wrong. \"Natural capital\" is an example of one theory combining both. Ecology mirrors anthropology. Sometimes ecology is compared to anthropology, because both use a lot of methods to study one thing we cannot live without. Anthropology is about how our bodies and minds are affected by our environment, while ecology is about how our environment is affected by our bodies and minds. There is even a type of anthropology called ecological anthropology, which studies how people interact with the environment. Antoine de Saint-Exupery stated: \"The earth teaches us more about ourselves than all the books. Because it resists us. Man discovers himself when he measures himself against the obstacle.\"",
   "Economics": "Economics is the study of how people make choices to satisfy their wants. There are three main ideas that are useful for understanding economics. Three ideas. Economics is a science that studies how people try to make use of the limited resources in the world to satisfy their wants. People's resources include their money, their free time, and their ability to work and make money. People have many wants for goods, such as the want for food, for houses to live in, and a new car to drive. However, there is only a limited amount of resources and goods available, which is called scarcity. For example, a person only has a limited amount of money and a limited amount of free time. This means that they have to make choices about how to spend these scarce resources on the different goods that they want. The advantage, when people work together. When people work together, there is an advantage for everybody. People concentrate on things they have very good skills off and produce especially theese goods (services). This principle can be used by countries and is an important argument for the free trade between economics. The subjects and objects in economics. The subjects of economic are households, business companies, the state and foreign countries. Households offer their production factors to the companies. This includes work, ground, capital (machines, buildings) and information. They get income whereof they buy and consume goods. Business companies produce and sell goods and buy production factors from the households and other companies. The state is divided in institutions and organisations. For example the United States of America consists of 50 states, where every state has his own area of responsibility. The state distributes the earnings from the business companies and households. These payments are called transfer payments. Public goods like streets or university education should be available for everyone. The last subject are foreign countries this includes all households, business companies und state institutions, which aren\u00b4t based in the mother land. They demand and supply goods from abroad. The objects in the economic are consumer goods, capital goods and factors of production. Consumer goods are classified in usage goods for example toilet paper, in purpose goods for example a car and in services for example a cleaning lady. Capital goods are goods, which are necessary for producing other goods. Examples for these are buildings, equipment and machines. Factors of production are work, ground, capital, information and environment. History. Economists are strongly influenced by their times, for example, Karl Marx lived in a time where workers' conditions were very poor. John Maynard Keynes lived through the Great Depression of the 1930s. Today's economists can look back and understand why they made their judgements, and try to make better ones. Branches of economics. The two main branches of economics are microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics looks at the behavior of individuals, homes, businesses or even groups of these. Microeconomics looks at prices of things and of services. It wants to help people decide how to divide society's resources. To do this, microeconomics wants to understand how decisions are made and how these small decisions affect bigger things. Macroeconomics looks at all the economy. It tries to explain the causes of numbers like national income, employment rates, and inflation. Connecting the two branches has been important and the general idea since the early 1980s. A good macroeconomic theory is based on microeconomics, meaning one can explain macroeconomic events using microeconomics for individuals.",
   "Egypt": "Egypt is a country in northeast Africa. Its capital city is Cairo. Egypt is famous for its very old monuments, such as the Pyramids and the Sphinx. Egypt has been an independent country since 1922. It is a member of the United Nations and the Arab League. It was a republic from 1952 after the revolution of 1952 by the leader Gamal Abd Alnaasar Egypt is a large country, but a large portion of it is desert. Most people live in areas around the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and along the Nile River. This includes the cities of Alexandria, Aswan, and Port Said. Not many people live in the desert. Today, Egypt has about 70 million people. Egypt is divided into 27 areas, called Governorates of Egypt. The Egyptian Parliament sits in Cairo and makes laws for the whole country. Today, the President is Hosni Mubarak. Today, the people of Egypt are mostly Sunni Muslims. There are still some Christians in Egypt today. Many of these belong to the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. Many famous people are from Egypt. Some of these include Omar Sharif, who was an international actor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who was the first person from Africa to lead the United Nations, and four Nobel Prize winners: Anwar Sadat, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978, Naguib Mahfouz, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1988, Ahmed Zewail, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1999, and Mohamed ElBaradei, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005. Egypt's climate is very extreme. It is either very cold or very hot, depending on the time.",
   "Everything2": "Everything2 or E2 is a website. It lets people make pages about many different things, and some people use it as a diary. E2 users create pages called \"nodes\" and add stuff in \"writeups\". Only logged-in users can create writeups. Only the person who created the writeup or someone who the website owners (called \"gods\") choose can edit the writeup. On the other hand, on Wikipedia, anyone can edit pages, but on Everything2 only those who can edit the writeup can edit pages. Everything2 does not require a neutral point of view like Wikipedia does. So, it is possible to have more than one article (writeups) under the same title (node), each by different authors, and presenting different points of view.",
   "Edit": "To edit a document means to change the order of words or pictures, or add new words or pictures, usually so that the edited product better represents what the editor, the person doing the editing, meant to show.",
   "Ecological yield": "Ecological yield is the harvestable growth of an ecosystem. It is most commonly measured in forestry - in fact sustainable forestry is defined as that which does not harvest more wood in a year than has grown in that year, within a given patch of forest. However, the concept is also applicable to water, and soil, and any other aspect of an ecosystem which can be both harvested and renewed - the so-called renewable resources. The carrying capacity of an ecosystem is reduced over time if more than the amount which is \"renewed\" (refreshed or regrown or rebuilt). Nature's services analysis calculates the global yield of the Earth's biosphere to humans as a whole. This is said to be greater in size than the entire human economy. However, it is more than just yield, but also the natural processes that increase biodiversity and conserve habitat which result in the total value of these services. \"Yield\" of ecological commodities like wood or water, useful to humans, is only a part of it. Very often an ecological yield in one place offsets an ecological load in another. Greenhouse gas released in one place, for instance, is fairly evenly distributed in the atmosphere, and so greenhouse gas control can be achieved by creating a carbon sink literally anywhere else. Ecocide is thought by some green economists to be accelerated by debt instruments which demand a yield (economics) greater than the ecological capacity to renew. This is a major question in monetary reform.",
   "Experience economy": "The experience economy is the intangible service economy that customers experience directly. In moral purchasing, Natural Capitalism and other theories of how consumers make choices, they are actually choosing experiences or comprehensive outcomes of their choices. For instance to buy local is to choose a whole experience of local suppliers, such as in a farmers market or Slow Food, that is quite different than the experience associated with factory food or fast food.",
   "Flesch-Kincaid Reading Level": "The Flesch-Kincaid Reading level measures textual difficulty and tells you the grade level of a text. The Flesch-Kincaid index tells how easy something is to read. It does this by counting the number of syllables in every word and the number of words in every sentence. Then some math is done. The number will represent a grade-school level. For example, a sentence with a score of 8.0 means that someone in 8th grade could understand it. Normal writing is usually between 7 and 8. 0.39 x Average No. of words in sentences + 11.8 x Average No. of syllables per word - 15.59",
   "February": "February is the second month of the year with 28 days in most years. In leap years February has 29 days. In Sweden in 1732 the month had 30 days. This was to make the calendar match the rest of the world. In 1930 and 1931, February had 30 days in the Soviet Union because the government changed all the months to be 30 days long. The name comes either from the Roman Mythology god Februus or else from \"februa\", the festivals of purification celebrated in Rome every fifteenth of this month. February is one of the last two months to be added to the calendar (the other is January). This is because in the original Roman calendar, the two months of Winter, when not much happen in agriculture, did not have names. From circa 700 BC, when Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, added it to the calendar, February had 23 days and 24 days on some of every second year, until 46 BC when Julius Caesar assigned it 29 days on every fourth year and 28 days otherwise. February's flower is the Violet with its birthstone being the Amethyst. The meaning of the Amethyst is Sincerity. Events in February. This is a list of annual events or festivals.",
   "Frying": "To fry food is to cook it in hot butter or vegetable oil. We can fry food in a small amount of butter or oil in a pan or in a lot of oil in a pot. Some restaurants also have large deep fryers to fry a lot of food at once.",
   "Fish": "A fish (plural: fish or fishes) is a kind of animal that lives in water, and breathes the oxygen in the water instead of air using gills, which are special flaps that let them breathe in water. There are many different kinds of fish. Fish usually have scales and fins. They live in fresh water in lakes and rivers, and in salt water in the ocean. Some fish are less than one centimeter long. The largest fish is considered to be the whale shark, which can be almost 15 meters long and weigh 15 tons. People and fish. People eat many kinds of fish. The fish that people eat most include carp, cod, herring, perch, sardines, sturgeon, tilapia, trout, tuna, and many others. Some people keep fish as pets. Goldfish and Siamese Fighting Fish are popular types of pet fish. They are often kept by groups of people in public ponds for their beauty and calming nature. Bony and cartilagenous fish. Most kinds of fish have bones. Some kinds of fish, such as sharks and rays, do not have real bones (their skeletons are made of cartilage) they are known as cartilagenous fish. Some scientists say that these are not real fish, but most people call them fish. Some other animals that live in the sea, such as starfish and jellyfish, are called fish, but are not really fish. The word \"to fish\" is also used for the activity of catching fish. People catch fish with small nets from the side of the water or from small boats, or with big nets from big boats. People can also catch fish with fishing poles and fishhooks with bait. This is often called fishing. there is also different types of lures that can be used. one is a crank bait. others are like plastic worms and rat-l-traps. these are ways of catching fish.",
   "Foot": "A foot (one \"foot\", two or more feet) is a body part on the end of a leg. We use it when walking, and it is important for balance: it helps us stand straight. We also use it to kick, in both fighting and sports, football being an example. People's hands and feet have the same shape: they both have five \"digits\" (the fingers and toes). Many other animals with backbones also have five digits. The part of the foot which joins it to the leg is called the \"heel\". The bottom of the foot is called the \"sole\". Half the bones in our body are in the foot. Doctors who work with people's feet are \"podiatrists\" or \"chiropodists\". Animals often have feet, and there are a lot of different sorts of foot. When an animal has soft feet, or feet with soft parts on the underside, we often call it a \"paw\". In many societies, people like to cover the foot when they are with others, especially outside. In many cultures (for example North American, European, Japanese and others) people wear clothing over the foot to keep it safe. This footwear has special names, for example \"sandals\", \"shoes\", and \"boots\". When people always wear footwear, especially in hot places or when they are very active, their feet can smell badly (\"foot odour\"). If footwear is too big or small, it can be bad for the feet when the person wears the shoe, and also much later. But people who have foot, leg, and back problems can also get help from special shoes. People have different traditions in different parts of the world for when to wear footwear. For example, in much of Europe and Canada, people usually do not wear their shoes or boots in a home or visiting. In the United States people often wear shoes inside a home. In Japan, people do not wear shoes, and floors are often made of very soft materials, too soft for shoes. In cultures where people always wear shoes, people sometimes think it is bad not to wear them. But wearing no shoes is good for the feet, especially for children's feet. Conditions like Athlete's foot affect the feet, causing the feet to feel dry and cracked.",
   "Fruit": "Fruit is a type of food that is not always something one is able to eat. It is part of a tree or bush or sometimes grown out of the ground like watermelons, that contains seeds. For plants, fruits are used so that the plant can make new plants. When the fruit breaks apart, the seeds can get into mud and start growing. () Most fruits we eat contain a lot of water. They contain natural sugar. They have a large amount of dietary fiber at the peel, seeds, and fibrous parts. All fruits contain iron, and they are very low in protein and fat content. Sometimes \"to bear fruit\" also means \"to produce results\".",
   "Farm": "A farm is a piece of land used to grow plants and/or raise animals for food. People who grow these plants or raise these animals are called farmers. This type of work is called farming. Land that is used to grow plants for food, or could be used to grow plants for food is called arable land. A life raising animals for food is called a pastoral life.",
   "Geography": "Description . Geography is the study of the Earth and its features, its inhabitants, and its phenomena. Its \"features\" are things like continents, seas, rivers and mountains. Its \"inhabitants\" are all the people and animals that live on it. Its \"phenomena\" are the things that happen like tides, winds, and earthquakes. A person who is expert in geography is a \"geographer\". A geographer tries to understand the world and the things that are in it, how they started and how they have changed. Geography is not the same as ecology. A geographer tries to describe how things are, while an ecologist thinks about changes that might happen in the future. Ecologists need the work of geographers so that they can work out the future. The word \"geography\" comes from the Greek words \"g\u00ea\" (\"Earth\") and \"graphein\" (\"to write\"). It means \"to write about the Earth\". The word was first used by a scientist called Eratosthenes (276-194 B.C.). Geography is divided into two main parts called Physical Geography and Human Geography. Physical Geography studies the \"Natural Environment\" and Human Geography studies the \"Human Environment\". The human environmental studies would include things such as the population in a country, how a country's economy is doing, and more. Geographers need to know a lot about maps because maps are very important for understanding geography. Geographers use maps a lot, and often make them. Making maps is called cartography, and similarly, people who make maps are cartographers. (It comes from the word for a \"chart\")",
   "Great Lakes": "The Great Lakes are five very big lakes in eastern North America. They are, in fact, the biggest fresh water lakes in the world (freshwater is water that is not salty like the ocean). Four of the Great Lakes are on the border between Canada and the United States of America. The other, Lake Michigan, is entirely inside the United States. Water flows from Lake Superior and Lake Michigan into Lake Huron; then through the Detroit River into Lake Erie; then through Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario; and then through the Saint Lawrence River to the Atlantic Ocean.",
   "GNU Free Documentation License": "The GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) is a copyleft license for open content. It was made up by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) for the GNU project. It was initially created for use with software documentation, but can be applied to other types of works as well. As a copyright license, the GFDL is a type of contract between the creator of a copyrightable work (such as a book, an encyclopedia article, a painting, or a piece of music) and anyone else who might want to use it. The GFDL is considered \"copyleft\" because the license is meant to make it easier to use and re-use the copyrighted work, not to restrict its use. If a copyrightable work is released under the GFDL, the creator of the work is saying that anyone else may reproduce, distribute, or modify the work, as long as they follow a set of requirements specified in the GFDL. Among the requirements of the GFDL are that any new work created from the original work is also licensed under the GFDL \u2014 that is, once something is licensed as GFDL, it will always stay licensed as GFDL, and anything which uses it also is licensed as GFDL. (Because the license \"reproduces\" and stays with the work, this is sometimes called a \"viral\" license.) The GFDL also says that in order to distribute or modify a work licensed with the GFDL, the re-user must give credit to any previous authors of the work, and include a list of changes they made to the work. Finally, any work licensed with the GFDL must contain, somewhere, the entire text of the license. This provision has been criticized, because it is not always easy to include an entire, long license with a copyrighted work. In a book, for example, it is easy to include one extra page with the license, but if the work is something like a song, or a photograph, it is not easy. The GFDL has other requirements that are more complicated. For example, if part of the work is labeled as an \"invariant section,\" it cannot ever be removed or changed by someone using the work (\"invariant\" means \"does not change\"). Works licensed under the GFDL may be included in with non-GFDL-licensed works only if it is clear which parts of the work are licensed as the GFDL. For example, in a book of poetry it would be easy to label some poems as licensed under the GFDL and some not licensed under it. But it would not be easy to label if part of a song was licensed as GFDL and the rest was not, so this would not be allowed. Any use of GFDL material which violates the terms of the GFDL is potentially copyright infringement. A number of online projects use the GFDL. The largest online project to license its content under the GFDL is Wikipedia. The GFDL has been criticized by many people who wish that it made it even easier for content to be re-used. Among the criticisms are that it is very hard to combine GFDL material with other copyleft licenses, that it is not always clear and easy to understand, and that some of its requirements, such as the \"invariant sections\", are not free at all.",
   "Glass": "Glass is a hard material that can be made in many shapes. It is usually transparent, but it can also be made in colours. Glass is often used to make windows and bottles. Many churches have windows made of colored glass. The word \"glass\" can also refer to a drink container. It does not have to be made of glass, but can be made of any material, for example plastic. Glass is used to make lenses. The word \"glasses\" is often used to mean eyeglasses. The myth that glass is actually a liquid emanates from the fact that old windows in houses/church's(2-300 years old) are sometimes a little out of shape, thicker in the bottom than on the top. However this phenomenon is due to the process of glass manufacture in the past which led to the glass pane being thicker at one end than the other. It was sensible to install the windows with the thick end at the bottom. Sometimes a window can be found with the thick end at the top of the window.",
   "God": "God as a proper noun is the word most commonly used to refer to the ultimate power across all religions. As an improper noun, the word \"god\" means a deity who has supernatural powers. Belief in God is commonly called by the term theism. Atheism is the word that refers to non-belief in God or any gods. God in the Abrahamic religions. The Abrahamic religions, including Judaism, Christianity and Islam, are popular monotheistic religions. Therefore, they believe in only one god. The name of God is traditionally not to be said in Judaism, but some people today call him YHWH (Yahweh) or Jehovah. Muslims commonly use the word Allah, which is simply the Arabic word for \"The God.\" Believers in the Abrahamic religions believe that the Abrahamic God has created human beings in his image, but this idea is rarely taken literally. The Abrahamic God's portrayal as an old man with a beard has been used in art since the Renaissance, but is not what most monotheists actually believe him to look like. Concepts of God in Christianity. The Christian Bible talks about God in different ways. According to Christians, the Old Testament talks about \"God the Father\"; the New Testament says something about Jesus. The New Testament says that Jesus was God's son. Many Christians also believe that Jesus was God's incarnation on earth. Christians consider the Holy Spirit to be God as well. In early times, Christians tried to solve this problem, as in the Old Testament, orTorah, there is purported to be only one god. However, in the New Testament, there were three who were said to be God. The most popular explanation they could find is called the Holy Trinity: The three mentioned are all part of the same God. Some Christians do not believe in the Trinity. Some believe that Jesus was just a man that talked about God and taught people about God. Members of the Unitarian Church have these beliefs. Christians believe that God came to Earth in the form of a man (Jesus) to save humanity. In this sense, God became man, and when Jesus prayed and talked to God, he called him \"Father,\" and taught others to do the same. God in Hinduism. In Hinduism, there is really only one God, who is referred to as Brahman. However, Brahman is said to have taken on many different incarnations, such as Rama, Krishna, Buddha, Shiva, Kali, Parvati, and Durga. To many outsiders, the worship of God's different incarnations in Hinduism is considered to be the worship of many gods. However, it is really only the worship of one God in different ways. Some Hindus also believe that the spirit of God lives in everyone. This idea is called Advaita Vedanta, which is the Hindu term for Monism. God in Other Eastern Religions. Religions like Buddhism and Confucianism involve the worship of many gods, or sometimes no gods at all. God in Western philosophy. Philosophers often try to understand gods through logic. When philosophers talk about \"God,\" they talk about a being like the one described above, but not about the god of any particular religion. God in philosophy is discussed without any religious texts. One of the earliest Western philosophers to write about God in a monotheistic way was the Greek Aristotle, who describes god as the Supreme Cause. Aristotle saw God as a being that makes everything happen, but is not influenced by anything else. There are also some philosophical problems with God. One of them is called God paradox. It is a question about whether (an omnipotent) God can make a mountain that is so heavy he cannot lift it.",
   "Ghost": "A ghost is considered to be the spirit of a dead person. Scientists say that there are no real ghosts, but many people believe that there are. There are many stories about ghosts in books and movies. Sometimes the ghost is the spirit of a person who was killed by enemies or who died in a scary way. The ghost may stay on Earth because he or she is angry due to some problem in life and wants to scare people or to harm his or her enemies. Sometimes ghosts are said to live in a particular locality, for example an abandoned house, and when occupants come they tease them to drive away or cause serious damage to the occupants. Sometimes the ghosts in these stories exist because of some problem the person had during life, that was not solved before he or she died. The ghost stays on the Earth trying to fix the problem. If the problem is fixed, the ghost can leave the Earth. Many ghosts stay on Earth also because they have died younger or have had sudden or abrupt deaths. Many people claim to have seen or heard ghosts, and are called Mediums. Many people believe they have seen ghosts. Others believe they have felt ghosts near them. Often the ghost is said to appear as a feeling of cold and a light or a misty cloud, but sometimes people say they have seen ghosts that look more like people. Sometimes ghosts are said to come in human form, that is, in the body of a person. Some ghosts might cause fear in the person who sees them, by being seen suddenly. Some ghosts are said to be friendly and help people who are in problems. The ghost might also appear as they did at the time of their death, including any blood or injuries. Ghosts can also appear and disappear as they wish. Many ghosts haunt the place they have died or a living loved one. (Or their murder, in some cases). Some may seek revenge or stay simply because they are confused. Ghosts can form right after they die, or even centuries later. Many people make up stories or urban legends. many try to prove the existence of these paranormal creatures with special technology such as heat sensors. They also make TV shows dedicated to proving the existence of ghosts, often investigating cases where a person has seen one or visiting a place where there was a sighting.",
   "God's eye view": "A special case of the last is in a wiki with a GodKing. Often this person can get others to believe what they say about what is right, without making any special effort to be fair to other views. Many people think Rene Descartes took a God's eye view when he said cogito ergo sum. George Berkeley argued that optics from Isaac Newton and Johannes Kepler also had this problem.",
   "Google": "Google is one of the biggest and most famous websites for finding things (Search Engine) on the World Wide Web (WWW). They also do things apart from searching. Other search engines (for example, AOL) use its software and information (database) too. That makes it the most-used search engine on the web. Every day, 200 million people use it. That is 200 000 000 people. Google's main office (\"Googleplex\") is in Mountain View, California, USA. With Google, people can also search for pictures, Usenet newsgroups, news, and things to buy online. By June 2004, Google indexed (or put in its database) 4.28 billion webpages, 880 million (880 000 000) pictures and 845 million (845 000 000) Usenet messages \u2014 six billion things. \"To google,\" as a doing word (verb) means \"to search for something on Google\"; because Google is so popular (over 50% of web users use it) it has been used to mean \"to search the web\". Google dislikes this use since Google is a trademark and Google can lose that trademark if people use it too widely. History. Google began as a project in early 1996 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, two students at Leland Stanford University, USA. They made it into a company, Google Inc., on September 7, 1998 at a friend's garage in Menlo Park, California. In February 1999, the company went to 165 University Ave., Palo Alto, California. Then, later that year, it went to another place, now called the \"Googleplex\". In September 2001, Google's rating system (\"PageRank\", for saying which information is more helpful) got a U.S. Patent. The patent was to Leland Stanford University, with Lawrence Page as the inventor (the person who first had the idea). Google makes a significant, though getting less (declining), percentage of it's money through its friends like America Online and InterActiveCorp. It has a special group known as the Partner Solutions Organization (PSO) which helps make contracts, help making accounts better, and The name \"Google\". The name \"Google\" is a misspelling on the word \"googol\". Milton Sirotta, nephew of U.S. mathematician Edward Kasner, made this word in 1938, for the number 1 and one hundred 0's. It is said that the word \"googol\" was chosen as a name for this number because it sounded like baby talk. Google uses this word because the company wants to make lots of stuff on the Web easy to find and use. Andy Bechtolsheim first thought of the name.(1 googol is 10 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000) The name for Google's main office, the \"Googleplex,\" (Very big Number) is a play on a different, even bigger number, \"googolplex\", which is 1 with 1 googol of 0's.",
   "Gallon": "A gallon is a unit of measurement used to measure volume. People have used many different gallons throughout history. There are three types of gallon still in use.",
   "Galaxy": "\"For the automobile, see Ford Galaxy.\" A galaxy is a group of many stars including gas, dust, and dark matter. Gravity holds galaxies together. Everything in a galaxy moves around a centre. The name galaxy is taken from the Greek word \"Galaxia\" meaning milky, a reference to the our own galaxy, the Milky Way. There are three main types of galaxies: ellipticals, spirals, and irregulars. All Galaxies exist inside the universe. There are an estimated one hundred billion galaxies within distance we can see or the Observable Universe. Each galaxy contains roughly one hundred thousand to one trillion stars. This makes the number of stars in the Universe more than every grain of sand on every beach on Earth. We can describe galaxies by the number of stars they have. The galaxy we call the Small Magellanic Cloud has about one billion stars in it. This is a small galaxy in comparison to most, but it isn't the smallest: Leo I and Leo II have about 1 million stars in them, and the Draco System has \"only\" a few hundred thousand stars. Astronomers call these galaxies \"dwarf galaxies.\" In general, smaller groups are called \"star clusters,\" not galaxies (a \"cluster\" is a group of something, like a cluster of grapes.) The largest star cluster, a globular cluster called Messier 15 has about 6 million stars, so we see that for small galaxies, there is a blurring together of what we mean by a galaxy and a large star cluster. In addition to their mass and numbers of stars, a galaxy is a collection of stars and gas which move through the universe independently of the Milky Way. Globular clusters are roundish swarms of stars that orbit the Milky Way, while the Leo and Draco Systems seem to be independent collections of stars. Many galaxies also continue to form new generations of stars. The Milky Way, and all spiral shaped galaxies like it (see above image of NGC 2997), produce new stars at a rate of one or two stars per year. These stars are formed in the vast interstellar clouds that account for about 1 to 10 percent of the mass of these galaxies. Globular star clusters, on the other hand, are not currently forming stars because this activity happened billions of years ago and then stopped once all of the gas and dust clouds were used up. It is hard to say if the galaxies we see are all that there really are. It is even hard to say if \"are\" means anything if we can never see or measure them. Models of our universe are sometimes finite, and sometimes infinite - if they are infinite we can never see all the galaxies. Often galaxies are also known as island universes.",
   "Goatee": "A goatee is a beard formed by a tuft of hair under the chin, resembling that of a billy goat.",
   "Main Page": "__NOTOC__",
   "History": "History is the study of the past. People know what has happened in the past by looking at things \"from\" the past: books, newspapers and letters. Libraries, archives or museums collect and keep these things for studying history. A person who studies history is called a historian. A person who study prehistory is called an archaeologist and they study artefacts like pottery and stone tools instead of written sources. People can learn about the past by talking to people who remember things that happened in the past. This is called oral history. When people who had been slaves and American Civil War survivors got old, some historians recorded everything that they said, so that history would not be lost. In old times people in different parts of the world kept different histories because they did not meet each other very often. Some groups of people never met each other. Medieval Europe, Ancient Rome and Ancient China all thought that they ruled the only important parts of the world and that other parts were \"barbarian\". Current events, modern economic history, modern social history and modern intellectual history take very different views of the way history has affected the way that we think today.",
   "Hawaii": "Hawaii is a U.S. state of the United States. It is the last state to join the United States. Hawaii became a state on August 21, 1959. It is the only state made only of islands. Hawaii is also the name of the largest island. The capital and largest city of Hawaii is Honolulu on the island named Oahu. Hawaii is known as the \"Aloha State\". \"Aloha\" is a Hawaiian word that has many meanings like welcome, hello and goodbye. Aloha also means love and care. The different meanings are brought together in the term \"Aloha Spirit\" to describe the friendly people of Hawaii. The state flower is the yellow hibiscus (\"Hibiscus brackenridgei\" or ma'o hau hele). The state bird is the Hawaiian goose (nene). The state fish is the reef triggerfish, also called the \"humu humu nuku nuku apua'a\". The state tree is the candlenut, also called \"kukui\". The state song is Hawaii Ponoi. The state motto is \"Ua mau ke ea o ka aina i ka pono\". In English it says, \"The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness\". The first people of Hawaii were Polynesians. They came to the islands sometime between 200 and 600 AD. Captain James Cook is given credit for discovering the islands for the Europeans in 1778. Others may have been there before him. Captain Cook named the islands the Sandwich Islands for the fourth Earl of Sandwich, John Montague. Kamehameha I was the first king of Hawaii. He united the separate small Hawaiian kingdoms into one large kingdom in 1795. In 1893, American soldiers stopped Queen Liliuokalani from leading Hawaii when American business people took over the government and made their own laws. She was the last monarch of Hawaii. She also wrote the original words of the song called \"Aloha Oe\". The American business people made Hawaii into a republic for a short time. The new leader, Sanford Dole was called the President of Hawaii. In 1898, the United States of America took over the government and made Hawaii into a territory. Hawaii is an archipelago; a long chain of islands. There are eight main islands and many small islands and atolls. They are the tops of underwater volcanos. The main islands are Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe, Maui and Hawaii. The biggest industry of Hawaii is tourism. Almost 7 million people visited in 2000. Important exports are sugar, pineapple, macadamia nuts, and coffee. Popular tourist sites include Waikiki Beach, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Polynesian Cultural Center, and the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor.",
   "Honolulu, Hawaii": "Honolulu is the capital city of the U.S. state of Hawaii. It is also the largest city in Hawaii and it has the most important harbor. It is on the south-east shore of the island of Oahu. Honolulu means \"sheltered harbor\" in the Hawaiian language. No one knows for sure when Honolulu was first settled or when the name was first used. Honolulu harbor was called Kulolia before foreigners came. The first foreigner was Captain William Brown of the English ship Butterworth, in 1794. He named the harbor Fair Haven. Other foreign captains started calling it Brown's Harbor. The name Honolulu was used some time after that. Honolulu quickly became the most important harbor of Hawaii. At that time, sandalwood was a big export. Honolulu was also an important supply point for whalers. Kamehameha III made Honolulu the capital city of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1850. It was also the capital of the Republic of Hawaii and the Territory of Hawaii. It stayed the capital when Hawaii became a state in 1959.",

   "Hydrogen": "Hydrogen is a chemical element. It is the simplest atom in the Universe. On a periodic table of the elements, hydrogen is on the top row, usually either on the left, on its own above the transition metals, or Above the Halogens. Its symbol in science is H. Scientists give atoms what they call an atomic number, and the number they have for hydrogen is 1. In its pure form hydrogen is most commonly found on Earth as a gas. Hydrogen is often found in water, but a water molecule is actually made up of one oxygen atom with two hydrogen atoms stuck on one side. Hydrogen is notable in that it is the fuel that powers the Sun and other stars. Pure hydrogen, though, is normally found in groups of two atoms. Scientists call this diatomic. Hydrogen will have a chemical reaction when mixed with most other elements. It has no color nor smell. However, hydrogen is very uncommon in the Earth's atmosphere. It is mostly found in water (where it is combined with oxygen) and in all organic compounds and living things. Hydrocarbons, like fossil fuels, are compounds where hydrogen is combined with carbon. The name \"hydrogen\" comes from the Greek word for water, '\u03c5\u03b4\u03bf\u03c1 (pronounced /HEEW-dor/). Hydrogen has two different isotopes which are heavier types of the Hydrogen atom, they are called: deuterium and tritium. These other types of Hydrogen are important in nuclear energy. Hydrogen as fuel (fusion). Scientists believe atoms are made of protons, neutrons and electrons. From a physics point of view, hydrogen has one proton, and its variants (atoms that are very like hydrogen), deuterium and tritium, also have neutrons. Nuclear fusion is a very powerful source of energy. It relies on forcing atoms together to make helium and energy, exactly as happens in a star like the Sun, or in a hydrogen bomb. This needs a large amount of energy to get started, and is not easy to do yet. A big advantage over nuclear fission, which is used in nuclear power stations, is that no waste is produced, and no toxic fuel like uranium is needed. There is a lot of deuterium in seawater. There is more than 600 million tons of hydrogen undergoing fusion every second on the sun. Burning Hydrogen. 1. Water can be easily broken down into hydrogen and oxygen with electricity, but it takes a lot of electricity to get a usable amount of hydrogen. 2. Burning hydrogen combines with oxygen molecules to make steam (pure water). 3. A fuel cell combines hydrogen through a catalyst with an oxygen molecule releasing an electron as electricity. Hydrogen power grid. For these reasons, many people believe hydrogen power will eventually replace technologies such as diesel-electric engines and biodiesel fuel. But it is not correct to see hydrogen as a fuel if it is used in a fuel cell. It is more of a replacement for the power grid. Such a grid and infrastructure with new vehicles might be first made in Iceland, a country that has much free geothermal energy and is quite small. Because it imports all fossil fuel, it would help Iceland to completely stop using it. The huge advantage of hydrogen is that when burnt in an engine or in a fuel cell, there is no pollution - just a small amount of water. It's a pain to store, though - it has to be kept under high pressure - and cooled as well. For vehicles, it seems more realistic to use liquid fuels, at least at present. If we did move to a hydrogen economy where could the hydrogen come from? Well, there are many places - it can be extracted from water (but this of course will use more energy than you would get back by using it in a fuel cell or an engine). It can be extracted from various types of plant material - corn is possible, though pretty inefficient. Generally it is probably better to refine such material into a more conventional fuel like ethanol.",
   "Italy": "Italy is a country in western Europe and a member of the European Union. Its official name is The Italian Republic'\". Italy is a democratic republic and a developed country. It is a founding member of the European Union. Italy is also a member of the G8, with the 7th largest Gross Domestic Product in the world. Its president is Giorgio Napolitano. Before 1861, it was made up of small city sates. Geography. Italy is a peninsula, meaning it is surrounded by the sea on all sides apart from one (its north side). Northern Italy is separated from France, Switzerland, and Austria by the Alps, a chain of mountains. Mont Blanc (\"Monte Bianco\" in Italian), the tallest mountain in Europe, belongs to this chain. The second important chain of mountains in Italy is the Apennines (\"Appennini\" in Italian), which are in central and southern Italy. The capital of Italy is Rome. Other important cities in Italy are Milan, Turin, Florence, Naples, and Venice. The country includes a number of islands, the biggest of which are Sicily and Sardinia, which are reached by ship or aircraft. Po River is the longest river in Italy. The Tiber River runs through the city of Rome. Northern Italy has some of the biggest lakes in the country, such as Lake Garda, Lake Como, Lake Maggiore and Lake Iseo. Because it is surrounded by the sea, Italy has many kilometers of coast, which brings tourists from around the world. Tourists also come to see Italy's many historical places. Italy includes in its territories two very small independent states, San Marino and the Vatican City. People and culture. People from Italy are called Italians. Most Italians are Christian, and most of the Christians are Roman Catholics. The population of Italy is about 58.5 million. About 2.5 million of these live in Rome, and 1.5 million in Milan. The official language of Italy is Italian and in some area German or French. People also speak languages such as \"Sicilian\" and \"Sardinian\", which are similar to Italian, but are different languages, or, dialects. The people of Italy are the descendants of the ancient Romans. Latin was one of the first languages of Italy. After the United States and many other countries in the world, Italy has the largest illegal immigrant problem in the world. Italy is home to more World Heritage sites than any other nation in the world. These sites are properties forming part of the cultural and natural heritage which the World Heritage Committee considers as having outstanding universal value. Aproximately 60% of the works of art of the world is concentrated in Italy. Italy makes more wine than any other country. Italy is famous for their Italian Wine, Pizza, fettucine, pasta, linguine, pepperoni, salami, varieties of cheese and Spaghetti. Regions. Italy is divided into 20 Regions (\"Regioni\" in Italian) and every Region is divided into Provinces. Politics. The Head of State is Giorgio Napolitano, whose task began in May 2006 and will end in May 2013 (the President of the Republic remains for 7 years). Napolitano is the eleventh President of the Italian Republic and he was preceded by Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. The first president was Enrico De Nicola. The Head of Government is Silvio Berlusconi, leader of a right-wing coalition, since 2008, when he defeated the left-wing coalition of Walter Veltroni. Italy was one of the first members of the European Union and in 2002, along with 11 other European countries, it changed to using the euro as its official currency. Before this, the Italian Lira had been used, from 1881. If you want to become President of Italy, you must have Italian citzsenship, you must be at least 50 years old, and you must not be barred from holding political and civil rights. History. Before 1861, Italy did not exist as a state, because its territory was divided into several independent states, often under foreign domination (by countries such as Austria, France, and Spain). From the 1850s, in Piedmont, a free Italian state, the Earl of Cavour had the idea of defeating the Austrian domination in Lombardy and Veneto to create a Northern Italian state. This happened, but other Central and Southern Italian states also decided to join Piedmont to create a bigger state. Particularly, in 1860, Garibaldi's mission in Southern Italy succeeded in conquering the Kingdom of Sicily, and the Kingdom of Italy was created. Vittorio Emanuele II was crowned King of Italy. But in 1861, Latium and Veneto were still not part of Italy, because they were under the power of the Pope and of the Austrian Emperor. Veneto was added to Italy in 1866, after a war against Austria, and Latium along with Rome was conquered by the Italian troops in 1870, when they entered the Pontifical State and declared the end of the temporal power of the Pope. The Pope, angry at this usurpation, declared himself prisoner in the Italian State, preventing Catholic people from participating in political life. Finally, in 1870, the Italian state was complete. Italy participated in World War I as an ally of Great Britain, France, and Russia against the Central Powers. The war was wholly fought on the Eastern border, near Austria. After the 'Caporetto defeat', it seemed that the war would be lost, but in 1918 the Central Powers surrendered, and Italy gained the Trentino-South Tyrol, which once belonged to Austria, though inhabited by Italian people. 1922 saw the rise of a new Italian movement, led by Benito Mussolini, leader of Fascism in Italy. He became Head of Government and dictator, calling himself 'duce'. He began a friendship with the German dictator Hitler and followed him into World War II. Italy entered war only in 1940 as an ally of Germany against France, Great Britain and Russia. During the war Italy controlled most of the Mediterranean sea, called in those years by Mussolini the Italian Mare Nostrum. On July 25, 1943, Mussolini was deposed by the Great Council of Fascism and on September 8, 1943, Badoglio declared that the war as an ally of Germany was ended. Italy started fighting as an ally of France and the UK, but Italian troops, due to the confusion deriving from the change, did not know who to shoot at. In Northern Italy a movement called Resistenza started to fight against the German invaders. Mussolini tried to create another Northern Italian fascist state, the Republic of Sal\u00f2, but it had no success. On April 25, 1945, Italy became free. The state became a republic on June 2, 1946, after a referendum in which for the first time women could vote. Italian people decided to put down the Savoia dynasty, who had been reigning since the beginning the state, in favour of a republican government. Transportation. The railway network in Italy totals 16,627\u00a0kilometres (10,331 mi). Italy is ranked 17th in the world. High speed trains include ETR-class trains which travels at 300\u00a0km/h (190 mph).",
   "Island": "An island is a piece of ground that is surrounded by water. Water is all around an island. Islands are smaller than continents. The largest island in the world is Greenland, unless Australia is believed to be an island. Some islands are their own countries. Examples of islands that are their own countries include Cuba, Iceland, and Madagascar. There are many others. Other islands have many countries, for example Borneo and Hispaniola.",
   "Immigrant": "Immigrants are people who move to another country or region than their own to live there. \"Immigrant\" and \"emmigrant\" do not mean the same thing. An \"immigrant\" is a person that leaves his or her own country or region and an \"emmigrant\" is a person that comes from other country or region. The phrases \"many people emigrated from Europe in the 19th century to America\" and \"many people immigrated to America from Europe in the 19th century\" have the same meaning.",
   "Interim": "Interim means \"in between\" or \"transitional\" (moving from one time or place to another), or \"temporary.\"",
   "Idiom": "An idiom is a word or phrase which means something different from what it says - it is usually a metaphor. Idioms are common phrases or terms whose meanings are not literal, but are figurative and only known through their common use. Because idioms can mean something different from what the words mean it is difficult for someone not very good at speaking the language to use them properly. Some idioms are only used by some groups of people or at certain times. The idiom \"break a leg\", means \"good luck\" to an actor about to start acting, but not to other people. Idioms are not the same thing as slang. Idioms are made of normal words that have a special meaning known by almost everyone. Slang is usually special words that are known only by a particular group. To learn a language a person needs to learn the words in that language, and how and when to use them. But people also need to learn idioms separately because certain words together or at certain times can have different meanings. In order to understand an idiom, one sometimes needs to know the culture the idiom comes from. To know the history of an idiom can be useful and interesting, but is not necessary to be able to use the idiom properly. For example most native British English speakers know that \"No room to swing a cat\" means \"there was not a lot of space\" and can use the idiom properly, but few know it is because 200 years ago sailors were punished by being whipped with a whip called a \"cat o'nine tails\". A big space was cleared on the ship so that the person doing the whipping had a lot of room to \"swing the cat\". Addendum. A better understanding of an idiom is that it is a phrase whose meaning cannot be understood from the dictionary definitions of each word taken separately. In this case, a metaphor is not an idiom. The meaning of the saying \"pay through the nose\" or \"run like the wind\" can be understood by looking the words up in a dictionary and using some common sense and imagination and the context of the phrase. In each of the above cases, to a language learner, the meaning of the phrases cannot be understood from the dictionary definitions of the words, nor from the context in which they are used.",
   "IELTS": "The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) tests how good you are at English language. People who take the test take the Academic Module or the General Training Module. The academic one is for people who want to go to university. The general one is for people who want to do other training or want to get work experience. People who want to emigrate to a country that uses English also take the general one. Most universities in Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States accept the IELTS. Many professional companies do as well. See also: International English",
   "Indian": "The word Indian means from or about the country of the modern Republic of India or Bharat. It refers to a person from India. Many different languages are used in India, so there is no one language called \"Indian\". Some languages of India are Gujarati, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Bengali, Kannada, Tamil, and Telugu. The word Indian is also sometimes used for the people who were in North America, Central America, South America, and the islands of the Caribbean Sea when the Europeans first came there. The Europeans made a mistake and thought they were going to India, so they called the people \"Indians\". Other names for these people are American Indians, First Nations, and Native Americans.",
   "Inch": "The inch is the basic unit of length or distance in the English system. A man's thumb is about an inch wide. The abbreviation for \"inch\" is \"in\" or \" (double quote). In the United States, people use inches more than they use millimeters or centimeters. Other U.S. customary units of measurement are also in common use. In the United Kingdom, road signs for speed limits are in miles per hour. In the rest of the world, metric units are almost always used. The inch is not used when referring to science.",
   "Immunology": "Immunology is the study of the immune system. Immune systems are biological systems that organisms use to prevent invasion and parasitism by other organisms. The simplest form of it is the DNA restriction system evolved in bacteria to prevent infection by bacteriophages. Usually, Immunology is taken to mean the study of mammalian immune systems, which are much more complex, and also prone to much error. Innate immunity. There are two broad, artificial subdivisions of mammalian immune systems: the innate (or natural) and the acquired (or adaptive). The innate immune system is usually meant to encompass cells and systems in the mammalian immune system that does not require previous exposure to a particular pathogen for function. Study of these focuses often on errors of the immune system, which often cause more damage than what they are detecting and reacting to. In effect, the immune system is what decides \"what is part of this body\" by ignoring its intervention. Some infections, like HIV exploit the limits or weaknesses of the human immune system very effectively and able to make themselves part of the body. Artificial means are often used to restore immune system function in an HIV-challenged body, and prevent the onset of AIDS. This is one of the most complex issues in immunology as it involves literally every level of that system. This research during the 1980s and 1990s radically changed the view of the human immune system and its functions and integration in the human body. Acquired immune response. The acquired immune system encompasses cells and systems that require previous exposure, and explains the somewhat unique ability of the mammalian immune system to 'remember' previous infections and mount a rapid and robust reaction to secondary infections. This immunological memory is due to the biology of T-cells and B-cells. Herd immunity for instance is acquired by organisms living close together sharing minor infections all the time. Vaccines boost the acquired immune system by offering weak forms of infection that the body can fight off and remember how to do so - when a stronger infection arises the body thus fights it off readily. The distribution of vaccines and other immune system affecting cures can be considered another level of acquired immune system, one governed by access to vaccination and medicine in general. The intersection of this with the spread of disease (as studied in epidemiology) is part of the field of public health. Integrated immune response. The natural or innate immune system of the human body is linked very deeply and directly to the nervous system and sensory system, a link first explored by studies on epilepsy. An epileptic attack is actually an immune system reaction triggered by a purely sensory or nervous input, like a strobe light. There are also studies of long term HIV survivors which suggest very strongly that psychology is a key healing factor and that it is quite possible to survive long term with very low immune system function if one avoids major psychological stress and stays quite calm and optimistic regardless of news. This might be because of the immune system's tendency to panic under conditions of high stress, to the detriment of the organism, sometimes attacking it from the inside. Because of these issues, a view is evolving of a single system that responds cognitively to perception, physiologically with pain via nerves, and immunologically with the more chemical elements of the immune system that float free in the human bloodstream. The study of this system is psychoneuroimmunology. The immune system protects the body.",
   "July": "July is the seventh month of the year with 31 days. July was named after Julius Caesar. July begins on the same day of the week as April every year and also January in leap years. July's flower is the water lily. July's birthstone is the ruby. The meaning for the birthstone Ruby is Contented Mind.",
   "Japan": "Japan (\u65e5\u672c) is a country in Asia. It has many islands. Four of them are large, and the biggest is one of the largest islands in the world. The islands are on the east Asian coast in the western part of the Pacific Ocean. Japanese people call their country \"Nihon\" or \"Nippon\", which in Japanese means \"the origin of the sun\". It is not actually the origin of the sun. History. The earliest records on Japan are from Chinese history. One of those records said there were many small countries which had wars between them and later a country, ruled by a queen, became the strongest and peace came. Japan began to write its own history after the 5th and 6th centuries, when people from Korea and China taught Japan about the Chinese writing system. Japan's neighbours also showed them the ways of Buddhism. The Japanese changed Buddhism in many ways, for example, by building strongly on ideas such as Zen, which came from mainland Asia. In the ancient and the Middle Ages, China gave Japan lots of new cultural ideas, but their friendship became weaker later. In the late 13th century, Mongolians from China tried to invade Japan twice, but they could not. The samurai and shogun of Medieval Japan are similar to knights and lords in Medieval Europe. Japan had contact with the Europeans for a little while in the 16th century. The Portuguese were the first Europeans to visit Japan. Later, the Spanish, English and Dutch came to Japan to trade. Also, they brought Christianity. Japan's leaders welcomed them originally, but the Europeans conquered many places in the world, and the Japanese were scared they would conquer Japan too. So the Japanese did not let the Europeans come into Japan anymore, except in a small area in Nagasaki city. Only Chinese, Korean and Dutch people were allowed to visit Japan, in the end, and they were under careful control of the Japanese government. Japan was opened again in 1854 by Matthew Perry, when the Americans wanted to use Japanese ports for American whale boats. This new contact with Europeans and Americans changed the Japanese culture. The Meiji Restoration of 1868 stopped some old ways and added many new ones. The Empire of Japan was created, and it became a very powerful nation and tried to invade the countries next to it. It invaded and annexed Ryukyu Kingdom, Taiwan, and Korea. It had wars with China and Russia: the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War, and the Second Sino-Japanese War, which grew to become a part of World War 2). Japanese troops did many bad things in East Asia, for example: the Nanking massacre (killing a lot of people), biological attacks of Unit 731 (killing people with chemicals and other deadly things). In 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, a naval base of the United States and destroyed or damaged many ships and airplanes. This started the United States' involvement in World War 2. American and Japanese forces fought each other in the Pacific. Once airbases were established within range of the Japanese mainland America began to win, and started dropping bombs on Japanese cities. America had full access to bomb most of the important cities and quickly brought Japan close to defeat. Because the Japanese refused to surrender, the United States dropped two atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing 130,000 Japanese citizens in just a few seconds. Soon after this the Soviet Union began to fight against Japan and the Japanese army in Manchuria lost. Japan surrendered and gave up all the places it took from other countries, accepting the Potsdam Proclamation. The United States occupied Japan and forced it to write a new constitution, in which they promised to never go to war again. Japan was hurt very much after the widespread bombing campaigns and the atomic bombs, but soon it grew strong again. They did not try to make a strong military, but a strong economy. Because of this, they became very wealthy. The United States put their military bases in Japan, including Okinawa. Although America helps protect Japan, some people living near the bases do not like the soldiers being there because of serious problems the soldiers sometimes make. Geography. Japan is a group of islands in the Western Pacific, off the coast of China. The four biggest islands are Honshu, Hokkaido, Shikoku, and Kyushu, and there are about 3,000 smaller islands there. Japan is separated from the Asian continent by the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea. Honshu, which means 'Mainland' in Japanese language is the biggest island. Hokkaido is the island north of Honshu. Kyushu is the island west of Honshu. Shikoku is the island to the south-west of Honshu. In the middle of Japan there are mountains. Most of mountains are volcanoes. Japan has many earthquakes. The recent big earthquake happened in 1995 near to Kobe. It was really bad. 90% of the people living in Japan only live in 10% of the land, near the coast. The other 10% of the people in Japan live away from the coast. Over 10 cities have over a million people in them. The biggest city in Japan is Tokyo, which is the capital. Territorial problem. Japan has 3 problems about territory. Transportation. Important international airports in Japan are Narita, serving as Tokyo's major airport and Kansai International Airport near Osaka, serving as the main airport for the Kansai region. For moving around in Japan, airplanes, trains and buses are mainly used for the public transportation. The Shinkansen is one of the fastest trains in the world and connects most of the biggest cities in Honshu and Kyushu. Subdivisons. Japan is divided into 47 prefectures.",
   "Judaism": "Judaism is one of the oldest religions on Earth. It was one of the first religions to believe in only one God (monotheism). There are about 13 million followers of Judaism worldwide, called Jews. There are Jewish laws, rules, and guidelines for all parts of life. These are taught in both written and oral traditions. Their holy book is called the Torah (\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4). Most Jews believe that the Torah was written by God. Beliefs. Maimonides was a famous Jewish teacher of the 12th century. He made a list of 13 principles that include the basic beliefs of Judaism. Mitzvot (Commandments). There are various important actions in Judaism. These are called \"mitzvot\". A \"mitzvah\" is a commandment (law, rule) from God to the Jewish people. Most people think of a mitzvah as 'a good deed,' or 'a good thing to do.' There are 613 mitzvot that Jews are told to do. Some are for every-day life, and some are done at special times. Many of these 613 commandments can not be done now, because the Holy Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed. The Commandments. Religious Jews believe that Moses brought the Ten Commandments and the Torah down from Mount Sinai. They also believe that there is another part of the Torah besides the 5 books of Moses. It is called the Mishnah, also called the Oral Torah or Oral Law. It explains how to follow the laws written in the 5 books. There is a commentary (explanation) of the Mishnah, called the Gemara. Together, the Mishna and the Gemara make up the Talmud. Traditional Jews believe that God gave the written Torah and the oral Torah to Moses and that Moses told it to the Jewish people, and that it is the same today as it was back then. Traditional Jews also believe that all of the commandments must still be followed today. Liberal Jews believe that the Torah was inspired by God but written by human beings. Liberal Jews believe that all of the ethical laws in the Torah must still be followed, but many ritual laws do not need to be followed today. It is considered good in Judaism to talk about the commandments and to try to understand how to follow them. The Talmud has many stories about Rabbis who argued about the commandments. There is a joke about this: \"Two Jews, Three Opinions.\" Over time, some opinions have become the rule for everyone. Some rules are still being argued about. There is no single leader of Judaism who can decide how to follow the commandments or what to believe. Even though Jews believe different things and they disagree about the rules, they are still one religion and one people. The Ten Commandments are special because they were heard by all of the Jewish people at Mount Sinai. However, in traditional Judaism, all of the 613 mitzvot in the Torah are equally important. Shabbat. One of the commandments is to keep the Jewish Sabbath or \"Shabbat\". Shabbat starts every Friday at sunset and ends on Saturday at sunset. Shabbat is a day of rest to thank God for making the Earth. The tradition of resting on Shabbat comes from the Torah. According to the Torah, God created the world in six days and on the seventh day, Shabbat, He stopped. Many Jews go to their temple or synagogue to pray on Shabbat. Traditional Jews are very careful about Shabbat. It is a special day. Everyone walks to the synagogue. They say extra prayers. No one goes far from home. People visit friends. They invite guests for dinner and for lunch. People study Judaism together. Liberal Jews do not follow all of the same rules. They go to synagogue and visit friends and have special meals. But they may also drive cars, go shopping, and use electricity. Kashrut - Jewish Food Laws. Jews who follow the religious rules called \"kashrut\" only eat some types of food that are prepared by special rules. Food that a Jew can eat is called \"kosher\" food. Traditional Jews are very careful about kashrut. They usually can not eat in non-kosher restaurants or in the home of someone who does not keep kosher. Sometimes, this makes it hard to visit people or to do business. It is important to understand that this is part of their religion. Liberal Jews may or may not keep kosher. It is best to ask them individually. Other Kosher Rules. There are other rules for kosher food as well. Kinds of Judaism. For a very long time, all Jews believed the same basic things about Judaism. About 200 years ago, a small group of Jews in Germany decided to stop believing in many parts of Judaism and try to become more \"modern\" and more like Germans. Those Jews were called Reform Jews. Today there are three main kinds of Judaism: Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox Judaism. There are also kinds with a smaller number of people, such as Reconstructionist Judaism, and Karaite Judaism, Each group has its own practices according to how it understands the Jewish laws. Some do not believe in keeping most of the laws. For example: Reform (also called Liberal or Progressive) Judaism does not require eating kosher food or keeping the Sabbath at all. Reform Judaism teaches Jews to focus on the ethical laws of Judaism. Conservative Judaism developed after Reform Judaism. The leaders of Conservative Judaism felt that Reform Judaism was too radical. They wanted to conserve (protect) Jewish tradition instead of reforming (changing, improving) it. Orthodox Jews do not believe that Reform or Conservative Judaism are correct because they change too many things in ways that are not allowed. In the most recent survey of Jews in the United States in 2000-2001, it was found that 35% of American Jews say they are Reform, 27% say they are Conservative, 10% say they are Orthodox, 2% say they are Reconstructionist and 25% do not say what type they are. In Israel, almost all Jews go to Orthodox synagogues. There are very few Reform or Conservative synagogues. In Israel, Jews do not call themselves Reform, Conservative, or Orthodox. Instead, they mostly call themselves \"Haredi\" (super-religious) \"Dati\" (religious), \"Masorati\" (traditional) or \"Chiloni\" (secular). Surveys suggest that about 20% of Israelis say they are secular, 25% say they are Dati or Haredi and 55% say they are traditional. Names of God. Names are very important in Judaism. Many Jews believe that a name not only tells you who someone is, but also tells you something about them. Names of God are very special in Judaism, so Jews do not write them or speak them fully but use other words instead. That is why Jews write G-d, with a \"-\" instead of an \"o\" \"HaShem\" Means \"The Name\". It is the word Jews use most often when not praying to talk about God. \"Adonai\" means \"My Lord.\" This name tells Jews about God's position. God is the King of the World, and his name Adonai lets us know that. \"Elohim\" means \"one who is strong enough to do everything.\" This name is used when talking about God's power to create or God's justice. This tells us that God is the creator and that God rules the world with just laws. The two names above are so special that Orthodox Jews use these names only when they pray and read the Torah. When they are not praying or reading the Torah, they say \"Hashem\" (The Name) or \"Elokim\". \"God\" - Some Jews write \"God\" by replacing the \"o\" with a dash, like this: \"G-d\". They do this because God's name is so holy they are not allowed to throw away a piece of paper with \"God\" written on it. However, if by accident \"God\" is written, then the paper can be disposed of in a special way and buried in a special place. Others say that \"God\" is just an English word, not Hebrew, and so it is not holy. \"YHWH\" (\"Yehovah\") is the most sacred name of God in Hebrew, and is not pronounced by most Jews. No one knows where the name came from, or what exactly it means. It looks like the Hebrew word \"hayah,\" which is the verb \"to be.\" (According to Hebrew scripture, when Moses asked God who God was, God told Moses \"I am that I am\".) Jews believe that the name YHWH shows that God is endless. Instead of trying to say it, most Jews say \"haShem\", which means \"The Name.\" Some people pronounce this name as \"Yahweh\", or \"Jehovah\". Scholars of religion sometimes refer to \"YHWH\" as \"the Tetragrammaton\", from Greek words meaning \"four letters\". History. The Jewish scriptures say that Judaism began with a man named \"Abram\" who lived in the city of Ur. According to the Midrash, Abram strongly believed that the people in Ur were wrong to pray to different gods and statues. The Torah teaches that the Torah was around when God created the world. He believed that there was really only one God who was not a statue. The Torah tells that God spoke to Abram and told him to leave Ur with his family and move to Canaan, were he started a new religion. God told him that his name would be changed to Abraham. The Midrash also says that angels taught Abraham a new holy language, which Jews believe is the language today known as Hebrew. Hebrew has continued to be the language of Judaism until today. Abraham's grandson Jacob is said to be the one who first had the name of \"Israel\". According to the Torah, at one time, the Hebrew people moved to Egypt because of famine in Caanan. The Pharaoh became worried that the Jews would take over, so he made them slaves. God told the Hebrew leader Moses to help free them. God sent many terrible punishments to the Egyptians to convince their Pharaoh to free the Hebrews. Finally, the Pharaoh let the Hebrews go free, but then decided to send the Egyptian army after them. The Hebrews escaped when God made the waters of the Red Sea open a path for them. The waters then returned and drowned the Egyptian army. The Torah says that after this, Moses met with God on Mount Sinai and received the Ten Commandments and the Torah from God. The Hebrews or Israelites, in twelve tribes, began a country called Israel in Caanan. They fought many wars against other peoples in the area. The name \"Jew\" comes from the name of one of these tribes, Judah. Later this country broke apart into two kingdoms, Israel and Judah. Israel was conquered by Assyria in the 8th century BC, and the people were taken away. Later Judah was conquered by Babylonia in the early 6th century BC, and its people were taken captive to Babylon. They were allowed to go back to Judah again when Babylon was conquered by Persia. Some Jewish people stayed in Babylon (now Iraq) and others also lived in other countries. By 50 BC, Judah (then called Judea) was ruled by the Roman Empire. During this time, the main language of Judea was Aramaic. The Jews did not like the Roman government or customs, and often made trouble for the Romans. In 70 AD, after a revolt against the government by the Jewish community, the Romans destroyed Judea's capital city, Jerusalem and sent almost all Jews into exile. After this, the Jewish people did not have their own country. They were a small minority in almost every place they lived. This time is called the Diaspora, when Jews spread around the world. They lived in many other countries. Jews living in Spain and Portugal used the language Ladino (also called \"Judeo-Spanish\"). Jews living in Germany, Poland, and Russia used the language Yiddish. Jews living in North Africa spoke Judeo-Arabic. Jews have lived in most, but not all, places in the world, including India, China, Yemen, and Ethiopia. Even today, Jews that do not live in Israel are often said to live \"in the Diaspora\". In some places, like India, Jews lived without any problems. In other places, like most of Europe and Islamic countries, there was bigotry or even hatred against Jews and they lived under unfair laws. Sometimes Jews suffered from outright persecution (that is: systematic hatred and violence), sometimes they were forced to dress in special, ugly clothes, pay higher taxes than others, not build higher houses than others, not to ride a horse or donkey etc. But Jews were known as skillful bankers. In Europe, where the Roman Catholic church forbade Christians from lending money against interest, Jews worked as bankers and money-lenders. One nomad nation, the Khazars, converted to Judaism in the 8th century. The Khazar khanate, which was located in the modern Ukraine and Byelorussia, was the only independent Jewish state before modern day Israel. The Khazar state was destroyed by the Eastern Vikings (Rus) in 987. The Jewish People have always believed that they have a special mission from God. They do things in their own ways, such as having special rules about food and eating, not working on the Shabbat, keeping their own holidays, and not marrying people from other religions. Because of this, people in many different times and countries have thought that the Jews were strange, and maybe dangerous. Many countries made laws that the Jews could not work in some jobs or live in some places. Sometimes Jewish people were killed because of their religion. The word \"antisemitism\" describes the hatred for Jews. During the 1930s and 1940s, the Nazi, or \"National Socialist\" government of Germany conquered most of Europe. They treated the Jews very badly, because they said that the Jews caused most of the problems for Germany in the First World War. The Nazi government killed more than six million Jewish people. Before they were killed, many of the Jews were made to be slaves, and some of them were forced to help in the killing and slavery of the others. In 1948 after World War II, the United Nations made the country of Israel for the Jews in Palestine, which is in the same place as the original Israel, in the Middle East. The land had been part of the Ottoman Empire before World War I. Then Britain controlled the area under the oversight of the United Nations. Many Jews moved back to Israel, then called Palestine, starting in the late 1800s. When the country of Israel was made in 1948, there were about 600,000 Jews in it. Today there are about 5,600,000 Jews in it. When Jews moved back to Palestine, there were people living there. Most of them did not want to live in a Jewish country. This was the beginning of the Israeli-Arab or Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which continues today. Jews have come to Israel from all over the world, bringing different languages, music, food, and history to create a unique culture. Israel is the only country in the world where most people are Jews and where Hebrew is the main language. Jewish history continues today in both Israel and the Diaspora. Outside of Israel, there are many Jews in the United States, Great Britain, Canada, France, Russia, the Uktraine, Germany, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, and Australia. There are smaller numbers of Jews living in other parts of the world. Some of the major problems faced by the Jewish people today include: resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and dealing with high rates of assimilation (loss of Jewish identity) in some countries, like the United States. Famous Jews. Many famous people have been Jewish or have come from Jewish families.",
   "King": "A king is a male who rules a country because of inheritance. A king usually comes to power when one of his parents dies. For much of history most countries were governed in this way, especially in Europe. In some countries people elected a new king from candidates. The wife of a king is called a queen. A woman who becomes a monarch because of inheritance is also called a queen. If a country has a king or a queen, that means it is a monarchy. A country which a king or queen rules is called a kingdom. See also emperor and prince.",
   "Kauai": "Kauai (Kaua'i in Hawaiian) is the oldest and fourth largest of the main Hawaiian Islands, in the United States. Known also as the \"Garden Isle\", Kaua'i lies 105 miles (170 kilometers) across the Kaua'i Channel, northwest of Honolulu on O'ahu. It is of volcanic origin. The highest point is Mount Waialeale, at the center of the island, 5,148 feet (1,570 meters) above sea level. The wettest spot on Earth, with average rainfall of 460 inches (11,648 millimeters) a year, is just east of Mount Waialeale. The high yearly rainfall has eroded deep valleys in the central mountain. It has made canyons with many scenic waterfalls. The city of Lihue, on the island's southeast side, is the seat of Kauai County. It is the main city on the island. Waimea, on the island's southwest side and once the capital of Kauai, was the first place visited by explorer Captain James Cook in 1778. The city is at the head of one of the most beautiful canyons in the world, Waimea Canyon, whose gorge is 900 meters (3,000 feet) deep. The island of Kauai was featured in Disney's 2002 animated feature film \"Lilo & Stitch\".",
   "Kaho'olawe": "Kaho'olawe is the smallest of the 8 main volcanic islands in the Hawaiian Islands, in the United States. It is located west of Maui and south of Lana'i and is 11 miles long by 6 miles across (45 sq. miles area). The highest point, Lua Makika, is 1,477 feet above sea level. The island is rather dry because its low height does not cause much rain (orographic precipitation) to fall from the northeastern trade winds. Kaho'olawe was used as a gunfire and bombing target by the United States military because of World War II, and a defense training area by the United States Navy from around 1941 until May 1994. Popular feeling in Hawai'i against this practice finally won, and the Navy has been trying to finish a cleanup of unexploded ordnance (bombs and explosive shells) from the island. Ordnance is still buried or lying on the ground. Other items have washed down gullies and still other unexploded ordnance lies beneath the waters offshore. In 1981, the entire island was included on the National Register of Historic Places. The island is planned to be given back to the Hawaiian people. In 1993, the U.S. Congress passed a law that \"recognized the cultural importance of the island, required the Navy to return the island to the State, and directed the Navy to do an unexploded ordnance (UXO) cleanup and environmental restoration\". The turnover officially occurred on November 11, 2003, but the cleanup has not yet been completed. The U.S. Navy was given $400 million and 10 years to complete the large cleanup task, but this work has gone much slower than planned. In 1993, the Hawaii State Legislature established the Kaho'olawe Island Reserve. It is made up of the whole island and waters out to two miles (3.2 km) from shore. By State Law, Kaho'olawe and its waters can only be used for Native Hawaiian cultural, spiritual, and subsistence purposes; fishing; environmental restoration; historic preservation; and education. Commercial uses are not allowed. The Legislature also created the Kaho'olawe Island Reserve Commission (KIRC) to manage the Reserve while it is held in trust for a \"future Native Hawaiian Sovereignty entity\". After the cleanup is finished, the restoration of Kaho'olawe will need ways to control erosion, restore the plant life, recharge the water table, and slowly replace alien plants with native ones. Plans will include methods for damming gullies and reducing rainwater runoff. Non-natives will temporarily stabilize some areas before the permanent planting of native plants.",
   "Kill": "The act of killing a living thing can be said to have happened when an outside force, usually another life form, has done something to cause it to die. When a human being is killed by the action or fault of another human being, this event is called a homicide. When a human being is killed by the action of himself (or herself), it is called a suicide. A kill is also the act of shooting down a fighter aircraft. There are laws against this.",
   "Live": "Live can be an adjective. It rhymes with \"five\".",
   "Life": "Note that many individual organisms are not able to reproduce and yet are still generally considered to be \"alive\"; see mule and ant for examples. However, these exceptions can be covered by defining life at the level of entire species or of individual genes (for example, see kin selection for one way that non-reproducing individuals can still enhance the spread of their genes and the survival of their species). The study of life is called biology and people who study life are biologists. Currently, the Earth is the only planet in the Universe known by humans to support life. The question of whether life exists elsewhere in the Universe remains open. There have been a number of false alarms of life elsewhere in the Universe, but none of these apparent discoveries have so far been confirmed. Currently the closest that scientists have got to finding life outside of Earth is fossil evidence of possible bacterial life on Mars. All life on Earth is based on the chemistry of carbon compounds. Some say that this must be so for all possible forms of life throughout the Universe; others describe this position as \"carbon chauvinism\". Most successful animal of the earth in terms of total weight: Antarctic krill, \"Euphausia superba\", with a biomass probably over 500 million tonnes. Lifespan is the length of life in each species. Death is the end of life in a living system, or in a part of it.",
   "Law": "The law is a system of rules that people are supposed to follow in a society or a country. The courts and police enforce this system of rules and punish people who break the laws, such as by making them pay a fine or other penalty or sending them to jail. In ancient societies, laws were written by leaders, to set out rules on how people can live, work and do business with each other. Today in most countries, laws are written and voted on by groups of elected politicians in a legislature, such as a parliament or congress. To follow the laws of a society is to do legal things. An activity is illegal if it breaks a law or does not follow the laws. A legal code is a written code of laws that are enforced. This may deal with things like police, courts, or punishments. A lawyer or jurist or attorney is a professional who studies and argues the rules of law. In the United States, there are two kinds of attorneys - \"transactional\" attorneys who write contracts and \"litigators\" who go to court. The \"Rule of Law\" is the law that says that Government can only legally use its power in the way the government and the people agree. It limits the powers a Government has, as agreed in a country's constitution. The \"Rule of Law\" prevents dictatorship and protects the rights of the people. When leaders enforce the legal code honestly, even on themselves and their friends, this is an example of the rule of law being followed. \"The rule of law\", wrote the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle in 350 BC, \"is better than the rule of any individual.\" Culture is usually a major source of the principles behind many laws, as people tend to trust the ideas based on family and social habits. In many countries throughout history, religion and religious books such as the Bible or the Koran have been a major source of law. Civil law and common law. Civil law is the legal system used in most countries around the world today. Civil law is based on legislation that is found in constitutions or statutes passed by government. The secondary part of civil law is the legal approaches that are part of custom. In civil law governments, judges do not generally have much power, and most of the laws and legal precedent are created by members of parliament. Common law is based on the decisions made by judges in past court cases. It comes from England and it became part of almost every country that once belonged to th British Empire, except Scotland, and the Canadian province of Quebec. It is also the predominant form of law in the United States, where many laws called statutes are written by Congress, but many more legal rules exist from the decisions of the courts. Common law had its beginnings in the Middle Ages, when King John was forced by his barons to sign a document called the \"M Religious law. Religious law is law based on religious beliefs or books. Examples include the Jewish Halakha, Islamic Sharia, and Christian Canon law. Until the 1700s, Sharia law was the main legal system throughout the Muslim world. In some Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, the whole legal systems still base their law in Sharia law. Religious law is often criticized by countries that are not ruled by a religious government, because it often has very harsh penalties for very minor crimes, and often results in the mistreatment of women and minorities. History of law. The history of law is closely connected to the development of human civilisations. Ancient Egyptian law developed in 3000 BC. In 1760 BC King Hammurabi, took ancient Babylonian law and organized it, and then had it chiseled in stone for the public to see in the marketplace. These laws became known as the Codex Hammurabi. The Torah from the Old Testament is probably the oldest body of law. It was written in about 1280 BC. It has moral rules such as the Ten Commandments, that tell people what acts are not permitted. Judiciary. The judiciary is a group of judges who resolve people's disputes and determine whether people who are charged with crimes are guilty. Most countries that follow common law have a system of appeals courts, up to a supreme authority such as the Supreme Court or the High Court. The highest courts usually have the power to remove laws that are unconstitutional (which go against the constitution). Legislature. In democracies, the people in a country usually elect people called politicians to be a representative in a legislature. Examples of legislatures include the Houses of Parliament in London, the Congress in Washington D.C., the Bundestag in Berlin, the Duma in Moscow and the Assembl\u00e9e nationale in Paris. Most legislatures have two chambers or houses, a 'lower house' and an 'upper house'. To pass legislation, a majority of Members of Parliament must vote for a bill in each house. The legislature is the branch of government that writes laws, and votes on whether they will be approved. Executive (government) and Head of State. The executive is the governing center of political authority. In most democratic countries, the executive is elected from people who are in the legislature. This group of elected people is called the cabinet. In France, the US and Russia, the executive branch has a President which exists separately from the legislature. The executive suggests new laws and deals with other countries. As well, the executive usually controls the military, the police, and the bureaucracy. The executive selects ministers, or secretaries of state to control departments such as the health department or the department of justice. Other parts of the legal system. The police enforce the criminal laws by arresting people suspected of breaking the law. Bureaucrats are the government workers and government organizations that do work for the government. Bureaucrats work within a system of rules, and they make their decisions in writing. Lawyers are people who have learned about laws. Lawyers give people advice about their legal rights and duties and represent people in court. To become a lawyer, a person has to complete a two or three-year university program at a law school and pass an entrance examination. Lawyers work in a law firms, for the government, for companies, or by themselves. Civil society is the people and groups that are not part of government that try to protect people against human rights abuses and try to protect freedom of speech and other individual rights. Organizations that are part of civil society include political parties, debating clubs, trade unions, human rights organizations, newspapers, and charities.",
   "Ludovic Lazarus Zamenhof": "Ludovic Lazarus (Ludwik Lejzer) Zamenhof (December 15, 1859 - April 14, 1917) was a Jewish-Polish eye doctor and scholar who created the international language Esperanto. Zamenhof was born in 1859 in the town of Bia\u0142ystok, Poland. At the time, Poland was a part of the Russian Empire. Bialystok contained three major groups: Poles, Belorussians, and Yiddish-speaking Jews. Zamenhof thought that one common language would join these groups and stop fights between them. His first language was said to be Polish. His parents spoke Russian and Yiddish in the home. His father was a German teacher, so Zamenhof learned that language from an early age. Later he learned French, Latin, Greek, Hebrew and English. He also had an interest in Italian, Spanish and Lithuanian. Zamenhof decided that the international language must have a simple grammar and be easier to learn than Volapuk, an earlier international language. The basics of Esperanto were published in 1887.",
   "Provinces and territories of Canada": "Canada's land is composed of thirteen parts: ten provinces and three territories. Canada is governed on the principles of a federation: the Provinces' governments share power with the Government of Canada (the federal government). The territories' governments have a more limited set of powers versus the federal government than that of the provinces'. The provinces are located in the south of Canada, and the territories are in the north, where fewer people live. Here is a list of the provinces, and their standard abbreviations, with their capitals (the cities where their governments have their offices).",
   "Leap year": "A leap year comes once every four years. It is the year when an extra day is added to the Gregorian calendar used by most of the world. An ordinary year has 365 days. A leap year has 366 days. The extra day is added to the month of February. In an ordinary year, February has 28 days. In a leap year, it has 29 days. This extra day is called a leap day. A year is a leap year if it can be evenly divided by four. For example, 1996 was a leap year. But a year is not a leap year if can be evenly divided by 100 and not by 400. This is why 1700, 1800, 1900 were not leap years, but 2000 was. We have leap years because instead of 365 days, the Earth really takes a few minutes less than 365 1/4 days (365.24219) to go completely around the Sun. Without leap years, the seasons would start one day earlier on the calendar every four years. After 360 years, the 21st of March (the usual start of spring) would come in winter, on what would otherwise be the 21st of December. A number of countries use a lunar calendar (based on the moon). They have leap years when they add an extra lunar month. Different calendars add the extra month in different ways.",
   "Litre": "A litre (liter in the United States) is the metric unit of volume. One litre is the volume of one cubic decimetre, that is a cube of 10 x 10 x 10 centimetre. A litre of water has a mass of about one kilogram. The abbreviation of litre is L or l. For smaller volumes the millilitre is used: 1000 ml = 1 l. The capital letter abbreviation \"L\" is preferred by some people as the small \"l\" can look like the number one \"1\".",
   "Lens": "A lens is a piece of glass or clear (transparent) plastic that changes the way things look, when you look at them through the lens. They may appear larger than they are, or smaller, or in a different shape. Lenses are used in spectacles (glasses) that people wear on their noses when they cannot see well without them. They are also used in cameras for taking pictures, and in binoculars, telescopes, microscopes, and magnifying glasses. A projector is an application of lens too. You even find lenses in your eyes. Covex: bulges outwards from the lens.",
   "Mathematics": "Mathematics is the study of numbers, patterns, and shapes. People who are experts at mathematics are called mathematicians. Mathematics can find useful answers to real problems. A common saying in the U.S. is \"Do the math,\" meaning check the answer and see that it is right. For example, if we want to know if a new medicine will help to cure a disease, mathematics is used to answer that question. The way mathematicians solve problems is deduction. Deduction is the use of thinking to discover new ideas from old. For example, from the simple idea of a triangle mathematicians found the Pythagorean theorem, that in a right triangle the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides is equal to the square of the longest side. Thus, if we know that the shorter sides of a right triangle are 3 inches and 4 inches, we can deduce that the longest side is 5 inches, because the square of 3(3^2) is 9, the square of 4(4^2) is 16, and the square of 5 (5^2) is 25; and 9 + 16 = 25. Mathematics is necessary in business, science, engineering, construction and many other jobs. About. Mathematics uses logic to study these things and to create general rules, which are an important part of mathematics. These rules leave out information that isn't important so that a single rule can cover many situations. By finding general rules, mathematics solves many problems at the same time. A \"proof\" gives a reason why a rule in mathematics is correct. The reason can include using certain other rules that everyone agrees are correct, which are called \"axioms\". A rule that has a proof is sometimes called a \"theorem\". Experts in mathematics perform research to create new theorems. Sometimes, mathematics finds and studies rules or ideas that have not yet been found in the real world. Often in mathematics, ideas and rules are chosen because they are considered simple or beautiful. Sometimes these ideas and rules are found in the real world after they are studied in mathematics. This has happened many times in the past. This means that studying the rules and ideas of mathematics can help us know the world better. Famous theorems. These theorems have interested mathematicians and people who are not mathematicians. These are theorems and conjectures that have greatly changed mathematics. Foundations and methods. Progress in understanding the nature of mathematics also influences the way mathematicians study their subject. History and the world of mathematicians. \"See also list of mathematics history topics\" Mathematics in history, and the history of mathematics. Name. The word \"mathematics\" comes from the Greek word \"\u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\" (m\u00e1thema). The Greek word \"\u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\" means \"science, knowledge, or learning\". Often, the word \"mathematics\" is made shorter into \"maths\" (in British English) or \"math\" (in American English). The short words \"math\" or \"maths\" are often used for arithmetic, geometry or simple algebra by young students and their schools. Awards in mathematics. There is no Nobel prize in mathematics. The most important awards a mathematician can receive are the Abel prize and the Fields Medal. The Clay mathematics institute has said they will give one million dollars to any mathematician who solves one of the Millennium Prize Problems",
   "May": "May is the fifth month of the year with 31 days. The month of May might have been named for the Roman goddess Maia or more likely the Roman goddess of fertility Bona Dea, whose festival was held in May. May's flower is the Lily of the Valley with its birthstone being the Emerald. The meaning of the Emerald is Success in Love.",
   "Music": "Music is an art that puts sounds together in a way that people like or find interesting. Most music includes people singing with their voices or playing musical instruments, such as the piano, guitar, or drums. The word \"music\" comes from the Greek word \"Muse\". In Ancient Greece the nine Muses were goddesses of music, poetry, art, and dance. Someone who is making music is called a musician. What is music? Music is sound that has been organized using rhythm, melody or harmony. If someone bangs saucepans while cooking, it makes noise. If a person banged saucepans or pots in a rhythmic way, they are making a simple type of music. Blues music was a music that was played by singing, using the harmonica, or the acoustic guitar. Jazz musicians used instruments such as the trumpet, saxophone. Music started many thousands of years ago. When early people first banged pieces of wood together and enjoyed the sound, they were discovering music. Early people also discovered that when they cut off the horns of animals they had killed and blew through them, they could make interesting sounds. People also blew into conch shells and made sounds that they liked. They probably started to sing or shout in celebration. History of Western Music. It is not known what the earliest music of the cave people was like. Some architecture, even some paintings, are thousands of years old, but old music could not survive until people learned to write it down. The only way we can guess about music before that is by looking at very old paintings that show people playing musical instruments, or by finding them in archaeological digs (digging under the ground to find old things), or by what ancient writers wrote about them. The earliest piece of music that was ever written down and that has not been lost was discovered on a tablet written in Hurrian, a language spoken in and around northern Mesopotamia (where Iraq is today), from about 1500 BC. Middle Ages. Another early piece of written music, from a later period, that has survived was a round called \"Sumer Is Icumen In\". It was written down by a monk around the year 1250. Much of the music in the Middle Ages (roughly 450-1420) was folk music played by working people who wanted to sing or dance. When people played instruments, they were usually playing for dancers. However, most of the music that was written down was for the Catholic church. This music was written for monks to sing in church. It is called Chant (or Gregorian chant). Renaissance. In the Renaissance (roughly 1400-1550) there was a lot of music, and many composers wrote music that has survived so that it can be performed, played or sung today. The name for this period (Renaissance) is a French word which means \"rebirth\". This period was called the \"rebirth\" because many new types of art and music were reborn during this time. Some very beautiful music was written for use in church services (sacred music) by the Italian composer Giovanni da Palestrina (1525-1594). In Palestrina's music, many singers sing together (this is called a choir). There was also plenty of music not written for the church, such as happy dance music and romantic love songs. Popular instruments during the Renaissance included the viols (a string instrument played with a bow), lutes (a plucked stringed instrument that is a little like a guitar), and the virginal, a small, quiet keyboard instrument. Baroque. In the arts, the Baroque was a Western cultural epoch, which began near the turn of the 17th century in Rome. It was exemplified by drama and grandeur in sculpture, painting, literature, dance, and music[1].[citation needed] In music, the term 'Baroque' applies to the final period of dominance of imitative counterpoint, where different voices and instruments echo each other but at different pitches, sometimes inverting the echo, and even reversing thematic material. The popularity and success of the Baroque style was encouraged by the Roman Catholic Church which had decided at the time of the Council of Trent that the arts should communicate religious themes in direct and emotional involvement.[citation needed] The upper class also saw the dramatic style of Baroque architecture and art as a means of impressing visitors and expressing triumphant power and control. Baroque palaces are built around an entrance of courts, grand staircases and reception rooms of sequentially increasing opulence. In similar profusions of detail, art, music, architecture, and literature inspired each other in the Baroque cultural movement[citation needed] as artists explored what they could create from repeated and varied patterns. Some traits and aspects of Baroque paintings that differentiate this style from others are the abundant amount of details, often bright polychromy, less realistic faces of subjects, and an overall sense of awe, which was one of the goals in Baroque art. The word baroque probably derives from the ancient Portuguese noun \"barroco\"[citation needed] which is a pearl that is not round but of unpredictable and elaborate shape. Hence, in informal usage, the word baroque can simply mean that something is \"elaborate\", with many details, without reference to the Baroque styles of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Classical period. The Classical period is about (1750-1825). Sometimes \"classical music\" is used to mean any art music that is not \"pop music\", but in the History of Music, the term \"classical music\" means music from the late 1700s and the first years of the 1800s. This was a time when people became very interested in ancient Roman and Greek art (often called the \"classics\"). In music, it was the time of composers like Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Ludwig van Beethoven. Orchestras became bigger, and composers often wrote longer pieces of music called symphonies that had several sections (called movements). Some movements of a symphony were loud and fast; other movements were quiet and sad. The form of a piece of music was very important at this time and becoming very popular. Music had to have a nice shape. They often used a structure which was called sonata form. Another important type of music was the string quartet, which is a piece of music written for two violins, a viola, and a violoncello. Like symphonies, string quartet music had several sections. Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven all wrote many famous string quartets. The piano was invented during this time. Composers liked the piano, because it could be used to play dynamics (getting louder or getting softer). Other popular instruments included the violin, the violoncello, the flute, the clarinet, and the oboe. Joseph Hadyn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart were so powerful in their music that they influenced the western style of music. Romantic period. The 19th century is called the Romantic period. In music composers were particularly interested in putting their feelings into their music. An important instrument from the Romantic period was the piano. Some composers, such as Frederic Chopin wrote quiet, expressive (quietly emotional) piano pieces. Often music described a feeling or told a story using sounds. Other composers, such as Franz Schubert wrote songs for a singer and a piano player called Lied (the German word for \"song\"). These Lieder (plural of Lied) told stories by using the lyrics (words) of the song and by the imaginative piano accompaniments. Other composers, like Richard Strauss, and Franz Liszt used just music to tell a story, which is called a tone poem. Composers, such as Franz Liszt and Johannes Brahms used the piano to play loud, dramatic (strongly emotional) music. Many composers began writing music for bigger orchestras, with as many as 100 instruments. It was the period of \"Nationalism\" (the feeling of being proud of one's country) when many composers made music using folksong or melodies from their country. Lots of famous composers lived at this time such as Franz Schubert, Felix Mendelssohn, Frederic Chopin, Johannes Brahms, Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Richard Wagner. Modern times. From about 1900 onwards is called the \"modern period\". Many 20th century composers wanted to compose music that sounded different from the Classical and Romantic music. Modern composers searched for new ideas, such as using new instruments, different forms, different sounds, or different harmonies. The composer Arnold Schoenberg (1874-1951) wrote pieces which were atonal (meaning that they did not sound as if they were in any clear musical key). Later, Schoenberg invented a new system for writing music called twelve-tone system. Music written with the twelve-tone system sounds strange and weird. Pure twelve-tone music never became really popular, but some composers such as Benjamin Britten use it occasionally, when it can be very effective. Igor Stravinsky (1882-1971) wrote music with very complicated (difficult) chords (groups of notes that are played together) and rhythms. Some composers thought music was getting too complicated and so they wrote Minimalist pieces which use very simple ideas. In the 1950s and 1960s, composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen experimented with electronic music, using electronic circuits, amplifiers and loudspeakers. In the 1970s, composers began using electronic synthesizers and musical instruments from rock and roll music, such as the electric guitar. They used these new instruments to make new sounds. Composers writing in the 1990s and the 2000s, such as John Adams (born 1947) and James MacMillan (born 1959) often use a mixture of all these ideas, but they like to write tonal music with easy tunes as well. Jazz. Jazz is a type of music that was invented around 1900 in New Orleans in the south of the USA. There were many black musicians living there who played a style of music called blues music. Blues music was influenced by African music (because the black people in the United States had come to the United States as slaves. They were taken from Africa by force). Blues music was a music that was played by singing, using the harmonica, or the acoustic guitar. Many blues songs had sad lyrics about sad emotions (feelings) or sad experiences, such as losing a job, a family member dying, or having to go to jail (prison). Jazz music mixed together blues music with European music. Jazz musicians used instruments such as the trumpet, saxophone, and clarinet were used for the tunes (melodies), drums for percussion and plucked double bass, piano, and guitar for the background rhythm (rhythmic section). Jazz is usually improvised: the players make up (invent) the music as they play. Even though jazz musicians are making up the music, jazz music still has rules; the musicans play a series of chords (groups of notes) in order. Jazz music has a swinging rhythm. The word \"swing\" is hard to explain. For a rhythm to be a \"swinging rhythm\" it has to feel natural and relaxed. A \"swinging rhythm\" also gets the people who are listening excited, because they like the sound of it. Some people say that a \"swinging rhythm\" happens when all the jazz musicians start to feel the same pulse and energy from the song. If a jazz band plays very well together, people will say \"that is a swinging jazz band\" or \"that band really swings well.\" Jazz influenced other types of music like the Western art music from the 1920s and 1930s. Art music composers such as George Gershwin wrote music that was influenced by jazz. Jazz music influenced pop music songs. In the 1930s and 1940s, many pop music songs began using chords or melodies from jazz songs. One of the best known jazz musicians was Louis Armstrong (1900-1971). Pop music. \"Pop\" music is a type of \"popular\" music that many people like to listen to. The term \"pop music\" can be used for all kinds of music that was written to be popular. The word \"pop music\" was used from about 1880 onwards, when a type of music called music was popular. Modern pop music grew out of 1950s rock and roll, (for example Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and Little Richard) and rockabilly (for example Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly). In the 1960s, The Beatles became a famous pop music group. In the 1970s, other styles of music were mixed with pop music, such as funk and soul music. Pop music generally has a heavy (strong) beat, so that it is good for dancing. Pop singers normally sing with microphones that are plugged into an amplifier and a loudspeaker. Musical notation. \"Musical notation\" means \"the way music is written down\". It is very useful to be able to read and write music because this is how composers (who may have lived a long time ago) can tell the person playing their music how they want their music to be played. Music is written on five parallel lines called a staff. Notes are put on the lines and in the spaces between the lines. It can be seen from the shape whether the music goes up or down. The lengths of the notes (how long they are played for) are shown by making the note-heads black or white, and by giving them stems and flags. Reading music involves being able to tell what the note is called and where to find it on the instrument, and being able imagine the sound, as well as learning about music theory (how music works: all about scales, intervals, ornaments, form, etc). This all helps someone to become a good musician. It is also useful to be able to play \"by ear\" (when people try to play music they have only heard). Most rock musicians, blues musicians, and folk musicians play \"by ear.\" This means that to learn a song, they listen to other people singing it, or to a recording, until they know how the tune of the song goes. By listening. People can enjoy music by listening to it. They can go to concerts to hear famous musicians perform. Classical music is usually performed in concert halls, but sometimes huge festivals are organized in which it is performed outside, in a field or stadium, like pop festivals. People can listen to music on CDs, iPods, television, or the radio. There is so much music today, in elevators, shopping malls, and stores, that music it often becomes a background sound that we do not really hear. Sometimes it is good to listen more closely to music: by trying to hear the different instruments and what types of notes the instruments are playing. By playing or singing. People can learn to play an instrument such as the piano, the guitar, the bass, the trumpet, the drums, or the tuba. They must choose an instrument that is practical for their size. For example, a very short child cannot play a full size double bass, because the double bass is over five feet high. People should choose an instrument that they enjoy playing, because playing regularly is the only way to get better. Finally, it helps to have a good teacher. By composing. Anyone can make up his or her own pieces of music. It is not difficult to compose simple songs or melodies (tunes). It's easier for people who can play an instrument themselves. All it takes is experimenting with the sounds that an instrument makes. Someone can make up a piece that tells a story, or just find a nice tune and think about ways it can be changed each time it is repeated. The instrument might be someone's own voice.",
   "Maui": "Maui is the second largest of the Hawaiian Islands, in the United States. It has a population of just over 100,000 and is 727 square miles (1883 km\u00b2) in size. Maui is part of Maui County, Hawaii. The larger (or better known) towns include Kahului, Wailuku, Lahaina, Hana, and Wailea. Main industries are agriculture and tourism. Maui was named for the demi-god Maui. In Hawaiian legend, he raised all the islands from the sea. Maui is also known as the \"Valley Isle\" for the large fertile isthmus (narrow land connection) between two volcanoes. Maui is a volcanic doublet: an island formed from two volcanic mountains that are joined together. The older volcano, Mauna Kahalawai, is much older and has been very worn down. In common talk it is called the West Maui Mountain. The larger volcano, Haleakala, rises above 10,000 feet (3,050 m). The last eruption of Haleakala happened over 200 years ago, and this lava flow can be seen between Ahihi Bay and La Perouse Bay on the southeast shore.",
   "Money": "Money is what people use to buy things and \"services\" (that is, to have things done for them) - and what they take for selling their own things or services (what they do for others.) There are many kinds of money in the world. Most countries have their own kind of money, such as the United States dollar or the philippine peso. Money is also called many other names, like currency or cash. Most of the time a state or a government prints paper money and makes coins at a special place called a mint. History of money. Money is what you use to buy things. The idea of trading things is very old. A long time ago, people did not buy or sell with money. Instead, they traded one thing for another to get what they wanted or needed. One person who owned many cows could trade with another person who owned much wheat. Each would trade a little of what he had with the other, and support the people on his farm. This is known as barter. Other things that were easier to carry around than cows also came to be held as valuable, and were used as trade items, such as jewelry and spices. When people changed from trading in things like cows and wheat to using money instead, they needed things that would last a long time, still be valuable, and could be carried around. The first country in the world to make metal coins was called Lydia, sometime around 650 BC, in the western part of what is now Turkey. The Lydian coins were made of a weighed amount of precious metal and were stamped with a picture of a lion. This idea soon spread to Greece, the rest of the Mediterranean, and the rest of the world. Coins were all made to the same size and shape. In some parts of the world, different things have been used as money, like clam shells or blocks of salt. Besides being easier to carry than cows, using money had many other advantages. Money is \"easier to divide\" than many trade goods. If someone own cows, and wants to trade for only \"half a cow's worth\" of wheat, he probably does not want to cut his cow in half. But if he sells his cow for money, and buys wheat with money, he can get exactly the amount he wants. Cows die, and wheat rots. But money \"lasts longer\" than most trade goods. If someone sells a cow for money, he can save that money away until he needs it. He can always leave it to his children when he dies. It can last a very long time, and he can use it at any time. Not every cow is as good as another cow. Some cows are sick and old, and others are healthy and young. Some wheat is good and other wheat is moldy or stale. So if a person trades cows for wheat, he might have a hard time arguing over how much wheat each cow is worth. But money is \"standard\". That means one dollar is worth the same as another dollar. It is easier to add up and count money, than to add up the value of different cows or amounts of wheat. Later, after coins had been used for hundreds of years, paper money started out as a promise to pay in coin, much like an \"I.O.U.\" note. The first true paper money was used in China between 600 and 1455, and paper money was also printed in Sweden between 1660 and 1664. Both times, it did not work well, and had to be stopped because the banks kept running out of coins to pay on the notes. Massachusetts Bay Colony printed paper money in the 1690s, and this time, the idea was here to stay. Today, most of what people think of as money is not even things you can hold. It is numbers in bank accounts, saved in computer memories. A large number of people still feel more comfortable using coins and paper, and do not totally trust using electronic money on a computer memory. Kinds of money. \"Commodity money\" can be used for other purposes besides serving as a medium of exchange. We say it possesses intrinsic value, because it is useful or valuable by itself. Some examples of commodity money are cattle, silk, gold and silver. Convertible paper money is money that is convertible into gold and silver. Gold and Silver certificates are convertible paper money as they can be fully convertible into gold and silver. Inconvertible money is money that cannot be converted into gold and silver. Notes and coins are inconvertible money. They are incovertible and are declared by the government as money. They are also a country's legal tender. Today, notes and coins are the currencies used in daily transactions. In a modern society, most of the money used is bank deposits. Electronic money is the money stored electronically in certain cash cards.",
   "Multiplication": "Multiplication is an arithmetic operation for finding the \"product\" of two numbers. Multiplication is the third operation in maths after addition which is the first, subtraction which is the second and then there is multiplication. With natural numbers, it returns the number of tiles in a rectangle where one of the two numbers equals the number of tiles on one side and the other number equals the number of tiles on the neighbouring side. With real numbers, it returns the area of a rectangle where the first number equals the size of one side and the second number equals the size of the neighbouring side. For example, three multiplied by five is the total of five threes added together, or the total of three fives. This can be written down as 3 \u00d7 5 = 15, or spoken as \"three times five equals fifteen.\" Mathematicians call the two numbers you wish to multiply \"coefficients\" together, or \"multiplicand\" and \"multiplicator\" separately. Multiplicand \u00d7 multiplicator = product. Multiplication between numbers is said to be commutative - when the order of the numbers does not influence the value of the product. This is true for the Integers (whole numbers), e.g. 4 \u00d7 6 is the same as 6 \u00d7 4, and also for the Rational numbers (fractions), and for all the other Real numbers (representable as a field in the continuous line), and also for Complex numbers (numbers representable as a field in the plane). It is not true for Quaternions (numbers representable as a ring in the four-dimensional space), vectors or matrices. The opposite of multiplication is division.",
   "Microsoft": "Microsoft Corporation is a very big company which makes computer software and videogames all over the world. Bill Gates and Paul Allen started the company in 1975. Microsoft makes Windows, Microsoft Office (including Microsoft Word), Internet Explorer, MSN, and the Xbox 360. These are just the most popular products - they make a lot of other ones too. Most Microsoft programs cannot be downloaded for free - people have to buy them in a shop or online. Some products (like the operating system, Windows) are already installed when people buy a new computer. Products. Windows is Microsoft's best-known product. It is an operating system, which means that it is the basic software that makes people's computers work and lets other programs work. Most computers have some kind of Windows, like Windows XP or Windows Vista. Microsoft Office is also very popular, and it lets people write documents on their computer with Microsoft Word, make charts and graphs with Microsoft Excel, make presentations with Microsoft PowerPoint, and other things. Internet Explorer lets people look at things on the Internet. Microsoft makes other programs on the Internet. A lot of it is called \"Windows Live\"-\"service\", like Windows Live Hotmail. The Xbox and the new Xbox 360 are videogame \"consoles\", which means they let people play videogames on their TV. Microsoft is one of three big companies that make consoles. The other two are Nintendo and Sony. Xbox Live lets people play online against other people anywhere in the world. Microsoft also makes many PC games.",
   "Islamic world": "The Islamic World consists of all people who are in Islam. It is not an exact location, but rather a community. When they do things together as Muslims, they are the \"umma\", which means \"community\" referring to all of the believers. The faith emphasizes unity and defense of fellow Muslims, so it is common for these nations to cooperate. Recent conflicts in the Muslim World have sometimes spread because of this desire to cooperate (see below). It is also likely that some have been made shorter and less damaging because of it. Some might even have never started. Demographics. Muslims are in many countries. In 52 nations, Muslims are the majority. Almost all are Sunni. They speak about 60 languages and come from all ethnic backgrounds. Media. The \"Al-Jazeera\" satellite TV network in the Arabic language is a news source many Muslims watch. In most Muslim nations, the government is the main source of news. This sometimes makes it very difficult or dangerous to make anti-government statements. There are, however, many other news programmes and websites in the Muslim world. Islam in law and ethics. Islamic law exists in many variations - in Arabic it is called shariah - five schools of which were created centuries ago. These are the classical fiqh: the Hanafi school from India, Pakistan and Bangaladesh, West Africa, Egypt, the Maliki in North Africa and West Africa, the Shafi in Malaysia and Indonesia, the Hanbali in Arabia, and Jaferi in Iran and Iraq - where the majority is Shia. All five are very old and many Muslims feel a new fiqh must be created for modern society. Islam has a method for doing this, al-urf and ijtihad are the words to describe this method, but they have not been used in a long time, and few people are trusted enough to use them to make new laws. So, in most of the Muslim world, people are very conservative, especially about alcohol, adultery, abortion and women working in jobs where they are used to lure customers. Muslim women often dress extremely modestly, and many do so by choice. But in some countries they have been forced to do so against their will. This is one of the things that causes tension between the Western World and that of Muslims. Islamic economics bans debt but in most Muslim countries Western banking is allowed. This is another issue that many Muslims have with the Western world. Islam in politics. One quarter of the world population share Islam as an ethical tradition. Many people in these countries also see Islam as a political movement. In democratic countries there is usually at least one Islamic party. Political Islam is powerful in all Muslim-majority countries. Islamic parties in Pakistan and Algeria have taken power. Many in these movements call themselves Islamists, which also sometimes describes more militant Islamic groups. The relationships between these groups and their views of democracy are complex. Some of these groups are called terrorists because they attack civilians of other non-Muslim nations, to make a political point. Conflicts with Israel and the US. Israel is very unpopular in the Muslim world, because of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the way that the state of Israel came into being in 1948 which many Arabs thought was unfair. Some Muslims see this as a fight against Judaism or Jews, but not all. In Morocco for instance, the Islamists recently invited Jews to join the party. Jewish groups also cooperate with Arabs in the West Bank, where Neturei Karta (anti-Zionist orthodox Jewish) leader Rabbi Mosche Hirsch served as the Minister for Jewish Affairs in the Fatah before there was a Palestinian Authority. Like the Arabs, this small group of Jews thought the way Israel was created was not right. However, very few Jews believe this, and most support Israel as a state. In 1979 there was a big shift in the way the Muslim world dealt with the rest of the world. In that year, Egypt made peace with Israel, Iran became an Islamic state after a revolution, and there was an invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union. A lot of things changed in that year. By 2001 the Soviet Union was gone, Jordan had also made peace with Israel, and on September 11, 2001 there were major attacks on the U.S. - which most people believe were made to drive the United States out of the Muslim world, especially Saudi Arabia. In many ways the events of 1979 led to the events of 2001. The 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and 2003 invasion of Iraq are called part of a War on Terrorism by the United States. Many or most Muslims see it as a War on Islam. After the invasion, the Islamic parties won more seats, and a majority of Muslims polled in many nations expressed support for Osama bin Laden and said he would \"do the right thing\". Olivier Roy is a French scholar who thinks that this does not express support for al-Qaeda or militant Islam but opposing colonialism and what many Muslims call racism - favourable treatment for Jews especially those living in West Bank settlements, many of whom have American or British passport, and which the United Nations says have no right to live there. The situation is very complicated and there are many different views of it. Organization. The Organization of Islamic Conference formed in 1969 lets the Muslim nations work as a group. Russia joined in 2003. The Arab League is a smaller group of only the Arab countries. OPEC is another forum where issues between the Muslim and non-Muslim world come up. In 1973 to protest U.S. support for Israel there was an oil embargo which caused the 1973 energy crisis. See also: list of Islamic terms in Arabic, History of Islam, haj",
   "Mechanistic paradigm": "Believers in this paradigm sometimes say that those who do not believe in it are following a cognitive paradigm - but almost no one uses this term, since it is redundant - cognitive science is already accepted as the most basic idea in the philosophy of science. But mechanists reject some of the ideas of cognitive scientists, like cognitive science of mathematics. Mechanistic thinking also assumes that philosophy of perception is much less important than cognitive scientists say it is - that humans and their beliefs and equipment do not generally add a lot of bias to a scientific theory. Thomas Kuhn said otherwise, that these things matter, and that the major assumptions of science, can shift drastically. This he called a paradigm shift. The shift from mechanistic to cognitive paradigm is an example of this. Later he used other words to describe the assumptions and beliefs, like mind-set, but the word \"paradigm\" is still used. Some say it is much over-used. Economics is often said to \"suffer from\" assumptions of the mechanistic paradigm. Sometimes those who believe in neoclassical economics and also in the mechanistic paradigm say they \"seek to unify physics and economics,\" as if people and particles behaved as two examples of the same kind of thing. Technology is often easier to make if people accept a mechanistic paradigm - but it may be harder to say why it does not work, if one believes in these ideas. For instance, creating diagnostic trees might be easier if one works from experience, not from an idea of how a technology should or must work. A controversial idea is that mechanistic ideas are just an older idea called scholasticism, with more mathematics. Both tried to work from what should or must be, instead of what experiment seemed to show. Another controversial idea is that scientism, belief in science as if it were a religion or ethical tradition, comes from this paradigm. Most scientists who are mechanistic do not say they see science as a guide to ethics, but try to keep them separate.",
   "Models of nature": "Most sciences create and use models of nature. Toxic waste. For instance, to dump toxic waste in a river will harm others down the river. But without models of nature we do not know who, and cannot say how much is harmful. Effects. Models of nature affect human decision-making. They are very important to human health, wellness and economics. They also matter in ethics, since most people wish to reduce harm done by their decisions. They matter in law because harms can be proven to have been done in a court. Forests. A forest is very hard to bring back to life, once it is degraded. Smaller models of bits of nature help to understand how much must be left, so future generations can use nature too. Preservation. To preserve nature, ecology movement activists now cooperate in a global power network. It includes not just parties in politics but also NGOs like Greenpeace, Earth First or World Wide Fund for Nature. Effects on maps. One model of nature they have agreed on is a map that shows ecoregions, which are the natural borders of ecology maps. According to this map, there are 867 regions divided into 8 ecozones - plus others which are in the ocean. Effects on language. Most anthropologists agree that aboriginal languages have a small model of local nature in them. For instance, there will be more words to describe snow in an Arctic language, and more words to describe shades of green in a rainforest. This is part of the reason to use ecology borders in politics, since people who do not live inside the border do not see or make the same distinctions about nature. Effects on humans. Economists study nature's services to see how hard it would be to replace what nature does for humans. They showed in 1995 that the services nature performed for humans were more valuable than all services humans perform for each other all over the world. The value of Earth as a living thing was much more than we could ever afford to replace with our own technology. There has been no real disagreement about any of this. Pricing all the value of Earth to humans gives a huge number - which proves the pricing is right, since, we must put a high price on anything we have no way to replace.",
   "Mustache": "The hair that grows on the upper lip of some men is called a mustache. The hair that grows on the sides of the face and chin of some men is called a beard. Some men have a lot of hair and a big mustache, and some have very little. In the modern world, many men shave part or all of their mustaches, or cut their mustache so it does not get very long. A chin beard with no mustache is called a goatee, whilst a chin beard with a mustache is known as a Van Dyke. Some animals such as walruses also have hair like this, and people sometimes also call this hair a mustache.",
   "Mile": "A mile is one of several measures of distance. It comes from the Latin phrase \"mille passus\" for \"one thousand paces\" (plural: \"milia passuum\"), and may have referred to the distance travelled when a Roman soldier's left foot touched the ground one thousand times when walking. In the USA and the UK \"mile\" refers mostly to the statute mile of 5,280 feet (1.609 344 km). When measuring significant distances for sea or air travel, the nautical mile is used. It is a distance equal to that covered by 1/60th of 1 degree of arc along the Earth's equator or a line of longitude. It works out to about 6,076 feet 01.386 inches (or exactly 1.852 km).",
   "Margarine": "Margarine is an artifical butter. It can be made from vegetable oil, or animal fat. It may also contain skimmed milk, salt and emulsifiers. Margarine is used in many baked products. It contains less fat than butter, so is often chosen instead of it. There are also \"low fat\" margarines, which contain even less fat. However, many types of margarine contain trans fats, which are unhealthy and can cause heart disease. Other vegetables fats, like olive oil, are a better choice for cooking.",
   "Milky Way": "The Milky Way is the galaxy that our Sun and we live in. It is named for the very bright band of stars that are best seen in the Southern Hemisphere. This band looks like milk. From there, the bright centre of the galaxy can be seen. In the Northern Hemisphere its edge can be seen. Since the Sun and Earth are about three quarters of the way to the edge, and since there are few stars at the edge, there is a very big difference in brightness. The name of the \"Milky Way\" comes from the Latin language, and it is a translation of \"Via Lactea\". This name was taken from the Greek word \"Galaxia\" (galax means \"milk\"). A galaxy is a big group of millions of stars that all orbit around their galactic centre, like planets orbit a star. It probably takes millions of years for a star to go all the way around the galaxy, and 225 million years for the sun to go around the galaxy. These cycles are important, because different areas of the galaxy have more asteroids, that will become meteors if they hit the Earth's atmosphere. Very large ones can do horrible damage - many scientists believe dinosaurs were made extinct by an asteroid that hit Earth about 65 million years ago. About every 30 million years, astronomers believe, the Sun and Earth go through a part of the galaxy that has more asteroids. At this time there is great danger. This is supposed to be coming up soon, either right now or in million years (nobody really knows) - but certainly before five million years. Another way the Milky Way has affected things is by superstitious belief in astrology. The Incan Empire was created in less than a hundred years because its founders believed that, when the Milky Way moved to a certain point in the sky by stellar precession, time would end. They wanted to be ready. That time was almost exactly when Spain invaded. The Inca did not fight because they believed the Spaniards to be divine justice. Their empire was destroyed and became part of what is now Peru.",
   "Metabolism": "Metabolism is the system of chemical activities by which a living thing gets power (energy) from other things such as food. This depends, for example, on how often someone eats. If they are hungry their metabolism slows down dramatically. Metabolism uses energy to fuel all organs involved in digestion and respiration and so on. The amount of energy used to carry out these life processes is called the BMR-rate or \"basal metabolic rate\". The bigger someone is, the lower their metabolism rate would become. This is due to a lower volume to surface area ratio.",
   "Microscope": "A microscope is a scientific instrument that makes things normally too small to see look bigger, so they can be seen better and examined correctly. People who use microscopes commonly in their jobs include doctors and scientists. The earliest microscopes had only 1 lens and are called \"simple microscopes\". \"Compound microscopes\" have at least 2 lenses. In a compound microscope, the lens closer to the eye is called the \"eyepiece\". The lens at the other end is called the \"objective\". Microscopes make things seem larger than they are, from 10 times larger to about 1000 times larger. This is much stronger than a magnifying glass.",
   "Mass": "Mass is the amount of matter in a body. An object has the same mass where ever it is. The SI unit of mass is the kilogram, written as kg. There are also many other units of mass, such as: grams (g), tonnes (t), pounds (lb.), and ounces (oz.). Other units of mass used in science and engineering include slugs, atomic mass units, Planck masses, Solar masses, and eV/c2. The last unit is based on the electron volt (eV), which is usually used as a unit of energy. Various types of scales, including balances, are used to measure mass. What gives mass. Physicists do not know what gives an object mass. The Standard Model of particle physics thinks that mass is caused by the Higgs field. Physicists are trying to find the Higgs field now using the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Mass can change. In physics, Special Relativity shows that the mass of an object becomes bigger when the object moves very fast. As the speed gets close to the speed of light the mass becomes very big. Some things that do not have mass on their own have mass because of their movement. This is true for light - a light photon has no mass, but its energy can act as mass when it hits something. In chemistry mass does not change. The mass of chemicals before a chemical reaction always equals the mass of chemicals after. This is called the Law of Conservation of Mass.",
   "Mars": "orbit: 227,940,000 km (1.52 AU) from Sun Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun in our Solar System. Mars is named after the mythological Roman god of war because it is a red planet, and red is the colour of blood. Appearance. Mars has two very small moons, called Phobos and Deimos. The planet Mars is made of rock. The ground there is red because of iron oxide (rust) in the rocks and dust. The planet has a small carbon dioxide atmosphere. The temperatures on Mars are colder than on Earth, because it is farther away from the Sun. There is some ice at the north and south poles of Mars, and also frozen carbon dioxide. Mars does not have any water on the surface now, except at the poles, but most scientists think it used to have water. The average thickness of the planet's crust is about 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi), with a maximum thickness of 125\u00a0km (78\u00a0mi). Earth's crust, on average 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi), is three times smaller as Mars\u2019 crust based to the sizes of the two planets if they are made equal. History of Mars. Mars has been known since old times. The Greeks named this planet Ares, after their god of war, but when the Romans took over the Greeks, they named the planet Mars. Some of the first attempts at mapping Mars were done by Giovanni Schiaparelli. What he saw through his telescope confused him. He saw what he called \"canali\", which were ditches dug for water to pass through. This started a rumor that there were other animals and life on Mars, possibly even aliens. Today, we know there cannot be any such aliens. Life, climate and atmosphere of Mars. Because Mars is the closest to the Earth in the Solar System, people have wondered if there is any kind of life on Mars. Mars has the most similar seasons to Earth of all the planets in our Solar System. It also has a very similar tilt in its axis of 25 degree angle. However, since Mars is further than the Earth from the sun, the seasons of this planet last longer than those of Earth. As a result, a year in Mars is longer than a year in Earth. The atmosphere of Mars is much thinner than Earth\u2019s. Amazingly, surface temperatures can range from -113\u00b0C at the winter pole to 0\u00b0C on the dayside during summertime. Popular culture. Some famous stories were written about this idea. The writers used the name \"Martians\" for intelligent beings from Mars. In 1898 H. G. Wells wrote \"The War of the Worlds\", a famous novel about Martians attacking the Earth. In 1938, Orson Welles broadcast a radio version of this story in the United States, and many people thought it was really happening and were very afraid. Beginning in 1912, Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote several novels about adventures on Mars. Today. As of March 2008, scientists have not found life on Mars, either living now or extinct. Several space probes without people have gone to Mars to study it. Some have orbited (gone around) the planet, and some have landed on it. There are pictures of the surface of Mars that were sent back to Earth by some of these probes. Some people are interested in sending astronauts to visit Mars. This would be difficult. The astronauts would be in space for many years, and it could be very dangerous because of radiation from the sun.",
   "Molecule": "A molecule is the smallest amount of a chemical substance that can exist. If a molecule were split into smaller pieces, it would be a different substance. Molecules are made up of atoms that are stuck together in a particular shape. Not all combinations of atoms are possible; atoms like certain shapes, but not others. For example, oxygen atoms always have two bonds with other atoms, carbon atoms always have four bonds with other atoms, and nitrogen atoms always have three bonds with other atoms. In gases like air, the molecules are just flying around. In liquids like water, the molecules are stuck together but they can still move. In solids like sugar, the molecules can only vibrate. With a molecular formula, you can write down the numbers of all atoms in a molecule. For example, the molecular formula of sugar is C6H12O6. That means that one molecule of sugar is made up of six carbon atoms, twelve hydrogen atoms and six oxygen atoms.",
   "Moral reasoning": "Moral reasoning is a topic studied in psychology and in moral philosophy. It studies how people think about moral issues, problems, and questions. Psychologists who have studied it include Lawrence Kohlberg and Elliot Turiel. Kohlberg said that moral understanding develops in three main stages as a person gets older, but Turiel said that there are three domains of moral understanding that develop at the same time as a person gets older. Moral philosophy, or ethics, is a major branch of philosophy. It is the study of value or quality. It covers the analysis and use of concepts such as right, wrong, good, evil, and responsibility.",
   "Number": "Numbers are also used for other things besides counting. Numbers are used when things are measured. Numbers are used to study how the world works. Mathematics is a way to use numbers to learn about the world and make things. Numbers for people. There are different ways of giving symbols to numbers. These methods are called number systems. The most common number system that people use is the \"base ten\" number system. The \"base ten\" number system is also called the \"decimal\" number system. The base ten number system is common because people have ten fingers and ten toes. There are 10 different symbols used in the base ten number system. These ten symbols are called digits. A symbol for a number is made up of these ten digits. The position of the digits shows how big the number is. For example, the number 23 in the decimal number system really means 2 times 10 plus 3, and 101 means 1 times a hundred (=100) plus 0 times 10 (=0) plus 1 times 1 (=1). Numbers for machines. Another number system is more common for machines. The machine number system is called the \"binary\" number system. The binary number system is also called the base two number system. There are two different symbols (0,1) used in the base two number system. These two symbols are called bits. A symbol for a binary number is made up of these two bit symbols. The position of the bit symbols shows how big the number is. For example, the number 10 in the binary number system really means 1 times 2 plus 0, and 101 means 1 times four (=4) plus 0 times two (=0) plus 1 times 1 (=1). The binary number 10 is the same as the decimal number 2. The binary number 101 is the same as the decimal number 5. Names of numbers. When dealing with larger numbers than this there are two different ways of naming the numbers in English. Under the 'long scale' a new name is given every time the number is a million times larger than the last named number. It is also called the 'British Standard'. This scale used to be common in Britain but is not often used in English speaking countries today. It is still used in some other European nations. Another scale is the 'short scale' under which a new name is given every time a number is a thousand times larger than the last named number. This scale is a lot more common in most English speaking nations today. Natural numbers. Natural numbers are the numbers which we normally use for counting, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 etc. Some people call these counting numbers. Some people say that 0 is a natural number, too. Another name for these numbers is positive numbers. These numbers are sometimes written as +1 to show that they are different from the negative numbers. But not all positive numbers are natural (for example formula_1 is positive, but not natural). Negative numbers. Negative numbers are numbers less than zero. One way to think of negative numbers is using a \"number line\". We call one point on this line zero. Then we will label (write the name of) every position on the line by how far to the right of the zero point it is, for example the point one is one centimeter to the right, the point two is two centimeters to the right. Now think about a point which is one centimeter to the left of the zero point. We cannot call this point one, as there is already a point called one. We therefore call this point minus 1 (-1) (as it is one centimeter away, but in the opposite direction). A drawing of a number line is below. If people add a negative number to another this is the same as taking away the positive number with the same numerals. For example 5 + (-3) is the same as 5 - 3, and equals 2. If they take away a negative number from another this is the same as adding the positive number with the same numerals. For example 5 - (-3) is the same as 5 + 3, and equals 8. If they multiply two negative numbers together they get a positive number. For example -5 times -3 is 15. If they multiply a negative number by a positive number, or multiply a positive number by a negative number, they get a negative result. For example 5 times -3 is -15. Integers. Integers are all the natural numbers, all their opposites, and the number zero. Rational numbers. Rational numbers are numbers which can be written as fractions. This means that they can be written as \"a\" divided by \"b\", where the numbers \"a\" and \"b\" are integers, and \"b\" is not equal to 0. Some rational numbers, such as 1/10, need a finite number of digits after the decimal point to write them in decimal form. The number one tenth is written in decimal form as 0.1. Numbers written with a finite decimal form are rational. Some rational numbers, such as 1/11, need an infinite number of digits after the decimal point to write them in decimal form. There is a repeating pattern to the digits following the decimal point. The number one eleventh is written in decimal form as 0.0909090909... Irrational numbers. Irrational numbers are numbers which cannot be written as a fraction, but do not have imaginary parts. Irrational numbers often occur in geometry. Irrational numbers are often refer to as \"J\" for its symbol. For instance if we have a square which has sides of 1 meter, the distance between opposite corners is the square root of two. This is an irrational number. In decimal for it is written as 1.414213... Mathematicians have proved that the square root of every natural number is either an integer or an irrational number. One well known irrational number is pi. This is the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter. This number is the same for every circle. The number pi is approximately 3.1415926359.... An irrational number cannot be fully written down in decimal form. It would have an infinite number of digits after the decimal point. These digits would also not repeat. Real numbers. Real numbers is a name for all the sets of numbers listed above This is all numbers but for imaginary numbers. Imaginary numbers. Imaginary numbers are formed by real numbers multiplied by the number i. This number is the square root of minus one (-1). There is no number in the real numbers which when squared makes the number -1. Therefore mathematicians invented a number. They called this number i, or the imaginary unit. Imaginary numbers were called \"imaginary\" because when they were first found many mathematicians did not think they existed. The person who \"discovered\" imaginary numbers was Gerolamo Cardano in the 1500s. The first to use the word \"imaginary number\" was Ren\u00e9 Descartes. The first people to use these numbers were Leonard Euler and Carl Friedrich Gauss. Both lived in the 18th century. Complex numbers. Complex numbers are numbers which have two parts; a \"real\" part and an \"imaginary\" part. Every type of number written above is also a complex number. Complex numbers are a more general form of numbers. Every equation can be solved using only complex numbers. The complex numbers can be drawn on a number plane. This is composed of a real number line, and an imaginary number line. 3i|_ 2i|_. 2+2i i|_ -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 -i|_.3-i .-2-2i -2i|_ -3i|_ To multiply two complex numbers is complicated. It is easiest to describe in general terms, with two complex numbers a + bi and c + di. formula_2 For example (4 + 5i) \u00d7 (3 + 2i) = (4 \u00d7 3 - 5 \u00d7 2) + (4 \u00d7 2 + 5 \u00d7 3)i = (12 - 10) + (8 + 15)i = 2 + 23i. Transcendental numbers. A real or complex number is called \"Transcendental number\" if it cannot be obtained as a result of an algebraic equation with integer coefficients. formula_3 Proving that a certain number is transcendental can be extremely difficult. Each transcendental number is also an irrational number. The first people to see that there were transcendental numbers were Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Leonhard Euler. The first to actually prove there were transcendental numbers was Joseph Liouville. He did this in 1844.",
   "November": "November is the eleventh month of the year. It has 30 days. Its name is from the Latin \"novem\" for \"nine\" (it was the ninth month of the year, before January and February were added). November begins on the same day of the week as March every year and also February except in leap years. November's flower is the Chrysanthemum with its birthstone being the Topaz. The meaning of the Topaz is Fidelity.",
   "National anthem": "A national anthem is a song that the people of a country use to remember and respect their country. Some countries, like Spain, have a national anthem which has no lyrics (words of a song)",
   "Nene": "The N\u00e9n\u00e9, or Hawaiian Goose, \"Branta sandvicensis\" is a species of goose found only on some of the Hawaiian islands. It gets its name from its soft call. This is an unmistakable species, with its generally brown plumage (feathers) and darker head. Its strong toes have much reduced webbing (skin between the toes), an adjustment to the lava flows on which it breeds. The N\u00e9n\u00e9 goes about on land much more than other water birds. When moulting (dropping old feathers and growing new ones), the N\u00e9n\u00e9 cannot fly, like other geese, a factor which almost caused it to die out. This is the world's rarest goose. Once common, hunting and predators brought to the islands such as mongooses, pigs and cats at one time reduced the population to 30 birds. However, this species breeds well in captivity (zoos and bird parks), and has been successfully re-introduced. There are also good numbers in wild bird collections. The N\u00e9n\u00e9 is the state bird of Hawaii.",
   "Internet slang": "Internet slang is slang words which are used on the Internet. Most of these words are new, such as Wiki and blog, which were not used before the Internet became popular. Some old words were given new meanings, such as mail (Which now means email), and these compare the old communication methods with the new ways using the Internet. There are many mixed metaphors on the Internet, such as boot (Which used to mean a shoe) and link (Which used to mean a join in a metal chain). Some existing acronyms, such as \"AFK\" (To mean \"Away from keyboard\") and \"IRL\" (To mean \"In real life\") were used on bulletin board systems before the Internet became popular. These are now used on the Internet, such as in chat rooms and on instant messenger software. Shorthand words. Shorthand is where a word is written in a shorter way because it is quicker and easier to type. It is also done to fit more text into a limited space. Acronyms. Internet slang uses many acronyms because they are quicker and easier to type. They are often shorthand for common phrases and idioms, but they can show somebody's emotions and their certainty. Leet speak. Leet speak (Written as: L33T or 1337) is the most common language on MMORPGs because rude words are not stopped by filters. This language is changing all the time because new words are made and used. A lot of the words use numbers instead of letters but some were made because of typing errors which are now done on purpose. Also, some suffixes are used, such as \"-age\" and \"-ness\". Some of the numbers and symbols used instead of letters are in the table below.",
   "Natural resource": "A Natural resource is a thing people can use which comes from Nature: people do not make it themselves. Examples of natural resources are air, water, wood, oil, solar energy, wind energy, coal water, minerals. Petroleum used in cars is not a natural resource, for example, because people make it. We often say there are two sorts of natural resource: \"renewable resources\" and \"non-renewable resources\". in every country or place can get all natural resources. When people do not have one resource where they live, they can a) use another resource, or b) trade with another country (for example, they can buy oil from their neighbors). Some resources are rare - difficult to find - so people sometimes fight to have them (for example, oil resources). When people do not have some natural resources their quality of life can drop. For example, when they can not get clean water, people may become ill; if there is not enough wood, all trees will be cut and the forest will disappear (deforestation); if there are not enough fish in a sea, people can die of starvation. Some examples of renewable resources are wood, solar energy, trees, wind, hydroelectric power, fish and sunlight.",
   "Negentropy": "Negentropy is reverse entropy. It means things becoming more in order. Time in science is defined as the direction of entropy. This makes it very hard to talk about ideas of time that would apply to negentropy or its effects. Life is considered to be negentropic because it takes things in less order, like dead food, and turns it into things in more order, like cells in the body, tissues, and organs. In doing so, it gives off heat. The outside or skin of an organism is always at maximum entropy because it is removing heat. Based on several different ideas of entropy, negentropy also would mean several different things. Cliff Joslyn proposed a list of ways to find entropy in ways other than measuring heat as given off by a body. Since it is living things looking for these ways, however, and since they create models that are in more order than the measurements they combine, thinking and science are also negentropic - just a part of life. The idea that living things order the universe is called the anthropic principle. It has a strong form which says that we are needed to do this. And a weak or obvious form which says if we were not here asking, it wouldn't matter. Cosmology is concerned with this and other issues of where life fits into models of our universe. Negentropy is not the only idea about life and how it affects our view of time. Most of engineering relies on linear time for risk analysis, economics on cyclic time like the business cycle, biology explores rhythmic time especially in systems of animal communication. Probably all of these ideas are useful for some thing, like the many ideas of entropy, and the many ideas of life.",
   "Neptune": "Neptune (), () is the eighth and last planet from the Sun in the Solar System. It is a gas giant planet with four hard-to-see rings. It is the fourth largest planet and third heaviest. It is 17 times heavier than Earth and is a little bit more heavy than Uranus. The planet was named after the Roman God of the Sea. The astronomical symbol for the planet is. Neptune's atmosphere (a layer of gas floating above planets) is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium (two types of gases), with small amounts of methane that is makes the planet blue. Neptune's blue color is much more brighter compared to Uranus, which has a similar amount of methane, so there might be another reason why neptune is blue. Neptune also has the strongest winds of any planet in the solar system, measured as high as 2,100\u00a0km/h or 1,300\u00a0mph. Neptune was discovered by astronomers, Urbain Le Verrier and John Couch Adams who were both honored for the discovery. The planet was the first to be discovered by mathematical calculations instead of using a telescope. Because of Uranus' weird movements in its orbit (the line which a planet follows in moveing), it made astronomers search for the new planet. The planet was visited by only one spacecraft, \"Voyager 2\" on August 25, 1989. Neptune once had a huge storm known as the \"Great Dark Spot\" which was discovered in 1989 by Voyager 2. However, the dark spot was not seen in 1994, and new spots were found since then. It is not known why the dark spot disappeared. However, NASA suggested for a future spacecraft to orbit and learn more about Neptune. The spacecraft was to be shared between the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the California Institute of Technology. Discovery. The first possible sightings of Neptune is thought to be by Galileo as his drawings showed Neptune near Jupiter. But Galileo wasn't credited for the discovery since he thought Neptune was a \"fixed star\" instead of a planet. Because of Neptune's slow movement across the sky, Galileo's small telescope wasn't strong enough to detect Neptune as a planet. In 1821, Alexis Bouvard published the astronomical tables of the orbit of Uranus. Later observations showed that Uranus was moving in an irregular way in its orbit, making some astronomers think of another large body being the cause of the irregular motions of Uranus. In 1843, John Couch Adams calculated the orbit of an eighth planet that would possibly be influencing the orbit of Uranus. He sent his calculations to Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, who asked Adams for an explanation. Adams began to make a copy of the reply, but never sent it. In 1846, Urbain Le Verrier, who wasn't working with Adams, created his own calculations but also had problems in encouraging any interest with his people. However, in the same year, John Herschel began to support the mathematical method and encouraged James Challis to search for the planet. After much delays, Challis began his unwilling search in July 1546. Meanwhile, Le Verrier had convinced Johann Gottfried Galle to search for the planet. Although Heinrich d'Arrest was still a student at the Berlin Observatory, he suggested that a newly drawn map of the sky, in the region of Le Verrier's predicted area, could be compared with the current sky to look for the displacement characteristic of a planet, as compared to a fixed star. Neptune was then discovered that very night on September 23, 1846, within 1\u00b0 of where Le Verrier had predicted it to be, and about 10\u00b0 from Adams' prediction. Challis later found out that he had seen the planet twice in August, failing to recognize it owing to his careless approach to the work. After the news of the discovery of Neptune spread, there was also a lot of nationalistic opposition between the French and the British about who was to be deserved credit for the discovery. Later, an international agreement decided that both Le Verrier and Adams together deserved credit. However, historians are now reviewing the topic after the rediscovery in 1998 of the \"Neptune papers\" (historical documents from the Royal Greenwich Observatory), which had seemingly been stolen by astronomer Olin Eggen for nearly three decades and were only rediscovered (in his ownership) right after his death. After reviewing the documents, some historians now think that Adams does not deserve equal credit with Le Verrier. Naming. Shortly after its discovery, Neptune was temporarily called as \"the planet exterior to Uranus\" or as \"Le Verrier's planet\". The first suggestion for a name came from Galle. He proposed the name \"Janus\". In England, Challis suggested the name \"Oceanus\". In France, Arago suggested that the new planet be called \"Leverrier\", a suggestion which was met with a lot of opposition outside France. French almanacs promptly reintroduced the name \"Herschel\" for \"Uranus\" and \"Leverrier\" for the new planet. Meanwhile, on separate and different reason, Adams suggested changing the name \"Georgian\" to \"Uranus\", while Leverrier (through the Board of Longitude) suggested \"Neptune\" for the new planet. Struve gave support of that name on December 29, 1846, to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Soon \"Neptune\" was internationally agreed among many people and was then the official name for the new planet. In Roman mythology, Neptune was the god of the sea, identified with the Greek god, Poseidon. Mass and composition. At 10.243\u00a0kg, Neptune's mass puts the planet between Earth and the largest gas giants; Neptune has seventeen Earth masses but just 1/18th the mass of Jupiter. It and Uranus are often considered to be part of a sub-class of gas giant known as \"ice giants\", given their smaller size and big differences in composition compared to Jupiter and Saturn. In the search for extrasolar planets, Neptune has been used as a reference to determine the size and structure of the discovered planet. Some discovered planets that have similar masses like Neptune are often called as \"Neptunes\". just as astronomers refer to various extra-solar \"Jupiters.\" The atmosphere of Neptune is made up mostly of hydrogen, with a smaller amount of helium. A timy amount of methane is also detected in the atmosphere. Important absorption bands of methane happen at wavelengths above 600\u00a0nm, in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum. This absorption of red light by the atmospheric methane gives Neptune its blue hue. Because Neptune orbits so far from the Sun, it gets very little heat with the uppermost regions of the atmosphere at \u2212218\u00a0\u00b0C (55\u00a0K). Deeper inside the layers of gas, however, the temperature rises slowly. Like Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the differences are larger: Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is strong enough to create the fastest winds seen in the Solar System. Several possible explanations have been suggested, including radiogenic heating from the planet's core, the continued radiation into space of leftover heat made by infalling matter during the planet's birth, and gravity waves breaking above the tropopause. Neptune's internal structure is basically very similar to that of Uranus' interior. There is likely to be a core, thought to be about 15 Earth masses, made up of molten rock and metal surrounded by a mixture of rock, water, ammonia, and methane. The heavy pressures keep the icy part of this surrounding mixture as solids, in spite of the large temperatures near the core. The atmosphere, extending about 10 to 20% of the way towards the center, is mostly hydrogen and helium at high altitudes. More mixtures of methane, ammonia, and water are found in the lower areas of the atmosphere. Very slowly this darker and hotter area blends into the superheated liquid interior. The pressure at the center of Neptune is millions of times more than that on the surface of Earth. Comparing its rotational speed to its degree of oblateness shows that it has its mass less concentrated towards the center unlike Uranus. Weather and magnetic field. One difference between Neptune and Uranus is the normal level of meteorological activity. When the Voyager spacecraft flew by Uranus in 1986 that planet was visually pretty much bland, while Neptune showed notable weather events during its 1989 Voyager fly-by. Neptune's atmosphere has the highest wind speeds in the solar system, thought to be powered by the flow of internal heat, and its weather is characterized by extremely active storm systems, with winds reaching up to around 2100\u00a0km/h, near-supersonic speeds. Even more regular winds in the banded equatorial region can have speeds of around 1,200\u00a0km/h (750\u00a0mph). In 1989, the Great Dark Spot, a cyclonic storm system the size of Eurasia, was discovered by NASA's \"Voyager 2\" spacecraft. The storm resembled the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. However, on November 2, 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope did not see the Great Dark Spot on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in the planet's northern hemisphere. The reason why the Great Dark Spot's disappeared is unknown. One possible theory is that heat transfer from the planet's core disrupted the atmospheric balance and existing circulation patterns. The Scooter is another storm, a white cloud group more south than the Great Dark Spot. Its nickname was given when it was first noticed in the months leading up to the \"Voyager\" encounter in 1989: it moved faster than the Great Dark Spot. Later images showed clouds that moved even faster than Scooter. The Wizard's eye/\"Dark Spot 2\" is another southern cyclonic storm, the second most strongest storm seen during the 1989 encounter. It originally was completely dark, but as \"Voyager\" came closer to the planet, a bright core developed and is seen in most of the highest resolution images. Unlike other gas giants, Neptune's atmosphere shows the presence of high clouds making shadows on a thick cloud deck below. Though Neptune's atmosphere is much more active than that of Uranus, both planets are made up of the same gases and ices. Uranus and Neptune are not exactly the same type of gas giants like to Jupiter and Saturn, but are rather ice giants, meaning they have a larger solid core and are also made of ices. Neptune is very cold, with temperatures as low as \u2212224\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212372\u00a0\u00b0F or 49\u00a0K) recorded at the cloud tops in 1989. Neptune also has similarities with Uranus in its magnetosphere, with a magnetic field strongly tilted comparative to its rotational axis at 47\u00b0 and offset at least 0.55\u00a0radii (about 13,500\u00a0kilometres) from the planet's physical center. Comparing the magnetic fields of the two planets, scientists think the extreme course may be characteristic of flows in the interior of the planet and not the result of Uranus' sideways rotational movement. Neptune's Rings. Very small blue colored rings have been discovered around the blue planet, but they are not well known as the rings of Saturn. When these rings were discovered by a team led by Edward Guinan, originally they thought that the rings may not be complete rings. However, this was proven wrong by \"Voyager 2\". Neptune's planetary rings have a weird \"clumpy\" arrangement. Although the cause is currently unknown but some scientists think that it may be because of the gravitational contact with small moons that orbit near them. Proof that the rings are incomplete first began in the mid-1980s, when stellar occultation were found to rarely show an extra \"blink\" just before or after the planet occulted the star. Pictures from \"Voyager 2\" in 1989 solved the problem, when the ring system was found to have several faint rings. The farthest ring, Adams, has three famous arcs now named \"Libert\u00e9\", \"Egalit\u00e9\", and \"Fraternit\u00e9\" (Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity). The existence of arcs is very hard to understand because the laws of motion would predict that arcs spread out into a single ring in a very short time. The gravitational effects of Galatea, a moon just inward from the ring, are now thought to have created the arcs. Several other rings were discovered by the \"Voyager\" cameras. Also with the thin Adams Ring about 63,000\u00a0km from the center of Neptune, the Leverrier Ring is at 53,000\u00a0km and the wider, smaller Galle Ring is at 42,000\u00a0km. A very small outward expansion to the Leverrier Ring has been named Lassell; it is surrounded at its outer edge by the Arago Ring at 57,000\u00a0km. New Earth-based observations published in 2005 appeared to show that Neptune's rings are a lot more unstable than thought before. To be exact, it looks like that the \"Libert\u00e9\" ring might disappear maybe quickly in less than 100 years. The new observations seems to puzzle our understanding of Neptune's rings into a lot of confusion. Neptune's Moons. Neptune has a total of 13 known moons. The largest, and the only one big enough to have the shape of a sphere is Triton, discovered by William Lassell just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself. Unlike all other large planetary moons, Triton has a retrograde orbit, showing that the moon was probably captured, and maybe was once a Kuiper belt object. It is close enough to Neptune to be locked into a synchronous orbit, and is slowly moving into Neptune and will one day be torn apart when it passes the Roche limit. Triton is the coldest object that has been measured in the solar system, with temperatures of \u2212235\u00a0\u00b0C (38\u00a0K, \u2212392\u00a0\u00b0F). Neptune's second known moon (by order of distance), the odd moon Nereid, has one of the most unusual orbits of any satellite in the solar system. From July to September 1989, \"Voyager 2\" discovered six new moons of Neotune. Of these, the strangely shaped Proteus is well-known for being as large as a body of its density, that can survive without being shaped into a sphere by its own gravity. Although it's the second most massive Neptunian moon, it has only one quarter of one percent of the mass of Triton. Neptune's closest four moons, Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, and Galatea, orbit close enough to be inside Neptune's rings. The next farthest out, Larissa was originally discovered in 1981 when it had occulted a star. The moon was credited for causing Neptune's ring arcs when \"Voyager 2\" observed Neptune in 1989. Five new unusual moons discovered between 2002 and 2003 were announced in 2004. As Neptune was the Roman god of the sea, the planet's moons were named after lesser sea gods or goddesses. Observation. Neptune cannot be seen with naked eye alone, since Neptune's normal brightness are between magnitudes +7.7 and +8.0, which can be out-shined by Jupiter's Galilean moons, the dwarf planet Ceres, and the asteroids 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, 7 Iris, 3 Juno and 6 Hebe. A telescope or strong binoculars will show Neptune as a small blue dot, similar in appearance to Uranus; the blue color comes from the methane in its atmosphere. Its small obvious size has made it difficult to study visually; most telescopic data was quite limited until the arrival of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics. With an orbital period (sidereal period) of 164.88\u00a0Julian years, Neptune will soon return (for the first time since its discovery) to the same place in the sky where it was discovered in 1846. This will happen three different times, also with a fourth in which it will come very close to being at that position. These are April 11, 2009, when it will be in prograde motion; July 17, 2009, when it will be in retrograde motion; and February 7, 2010, when it will be in prograde motion. It will also come very close to being at the same point since the 1846 discovery in late October through early-mid November 2010, when Neptune will turn from retrograde to direct motion on the exact degree of Neptune's discovery and will then stop for a moment along the ecliptic within 2 arc minutes at that point (closest on November 7, 2010). This will be the last time for about the next 165 years that Neptune will be at its point of discovery. This is explained by the idea of retrogradation. Like all planets and asteroids in the Solar System beyond Earth, Neptune goes through retrogradation at certain points during its synodic period. In addition to the start of retrogradation, other events inside the synodic period include astronomical opposition, the return to prograde motion, and conjunction to the Sun. In its orbit around the Sun, Neptune will return to its original point of discovery in August 2011. Exploration. Currently, only one spacecraft has visited Neptune. NASA's \"Voyager 2\" probe made a quick fly-by of the planet with its closest encounter on August 25, 1989, and was the last planet to have been visited by at least one spacecraft. Some of \"Voyager 2\"s important discoveries was its very close fly-by of Triton where took pictures of several parts of the moon. The probe also discovered the Great Dark Spot, although it has now disappeared after when the Hubble Space Telescope took pictures of Neptune in 1994. Originally thought to be a large cloud or cyclonic storm system, it was later guessed just to be a hole in the visible cloud deck. Neptune turned out to have the strongest winds of all the solar system's gas giants. In the outer regions of the solar system, where the Sun shines over 1000 times fainter than on Earth (still very bright with a magnitude of -21), the last of the four giants did happen as what the scientists actually expected. One might think that the farther a planet is from the Sun, the less energy and heat there would be to create and run the very strong winds around. The winds on Jupiter were already hundreds of kilometres per hour. Rather than seeing slower winds, the scientists found faster winds (over 1600\u00a0km/h) on more distant Neptune. One possible guess for the cause of the faster wind speeds is that if enough energy is produced, turbulence is created, which slows the winds down (like those of Jupiter). At Neptune however, there is so little solar energy that once winds are started they meet very little resistance, and are able to keep very high speeds. Anyhow, Neptune gives out more energy than it gets from the Sun, and the internal energy source of these winds remains undetermined. The pictures sent back to Earth from \"Voyager 2\" in 1989 became the basis of a PBS all-night program called \"Neptune All Night\".",
   "Negative": "Negative is a word that has at least three separate meanings. If a person or a company has \"negative net worth,\" this means that the money they owe to others is more than the money and other things they have or are going to get.",
   "No one": "No One is an English idiom meaning \"no person\" or \"no body\". It is the opposite of \"someone\". It means effectively \"no one who counts or can be heard or respected\" or more exactly \"zero persons that we are concerned with,\" whoever \"we\" (those making the statement or agreeing to it or thought to do so) are. It literally refers to \"zero persons or voices\". But this is not always exactly what is meant. It does not usually literally mean that absolutely no human body on Earth can be found that expresses the view or takes the position that \"no one\" takes. It means that the view or position can be safely ignored, and that those who take it can be singled out for social exclusion. So, for instance, it can be said that \"No one in the United States supports communism.\" But of course there are a few such people, they are just not open or declared supporters, or not found, or they \"should not be in\" the US. Use of this term usually implies that an ideology is advocated or a challenge is being issued to find someone willing to state support for, or publicly do, the thing that no one is in favour of, or doing. To \"volunteer someone\" for instance, means that \"no one\" will actually volunteer, and that they must be conscripted instead by choice of someone other than themselves, say a commanding officer in the military. This term arises from US military jargon.",
   "Now": "Now is the time span between the past and the future. It can be long (like an eon in geologic time) or short (like a picosecond) but it is almost always used to refer to the span between the present instant to some time horizon when a decision must be made. It can be used to ask or demand that someone make a decision even if they want to delay. \"I want to know what you think, now.\" \"Now is the time for all good people to come to the aid of their country.\" Mathematics and measurement assume that everything used in one equation equals the same quantities at the beginning of calculation or axiomatization as at the end. That means it is mathematically correct to say that the idea of \"equal\" means \"equal from the time the process starts to the time it ends.\" In General Semantics and E Prime the words equal, remain (for the past until now) and become (for now into the future) replace the verb \"to be\" for this reason. Algebra is now often called snapshot algebra or algebra of seeing because of this dependance on time. If any action or event were possible between steps in algebraic analysis, then, in theory, one would have to start over as if one had no knowledge of the new state at all. For these reasons the idea of statistics and also knowledge and knowledge management are sometimes questioned, for instance, in the book \"Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics\". A major issue is the comparing of numbers gathered in the past, and now, after some key conditions change.",
   "New York City, New York": "New York City is the largest city in the United States. It is in the state of New York, which is in the northeast of the country. History. The oldest part of the city, the island of Manhattan, still has its original Lenape Native American name. Although Native people such as the Lenape and Canarsees had lived there for many thousands of years, New York City was first explored by Europeans in the 1500's. Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazano found the entrance to New York Harbor in the year 1524 and English explorer Henry Hudson found the Hudson River in 1609. New York City was settled by Europeans from The Netherlands in 1624. The Dutch called the whole area of New York \"Nieuw Nederland\" and they named a fort and town on the south end of Manhattan Island Nieuw Amsterdam (New Amsterdam), after the capital city of the Netherlands, which was to become present-day New York. When the English took over the colony in 1664 they changed the name to New York, to honor the Duke of York, who later became King Charles II of England. The Dutch surrendered Nieuw Amsterdam without fighting. They were afraid of the English Navy so they traded the town to England for the colony of Surinam in South America, which they thought was worth more money. By the time the English came to New York, there were many other Dutch towns in what would become New York City, including Breukelen (Brooklyn), Vlissingen (Flushing), and Nieuw Haarlem (Harlem). There were already some English towns in the area also, such as Gravesend in Brooklyn and Newtown in Queens. Dutch and English people had been living together in New York for a long time. New York quickly grew to become a large and important port city. Many important battles of the American Revolution were fought in northern Manhattan and in Brooklyn. New York was the capital of the United States from 1789 until 1800. In 1898, the cities of New York and Brooklyn merged with the Bronx, Staten Island, and the towns in Queens County to form Greater New York. This is the total area of the City of New York today. Geography. New York City is an archipelago (group of islands) near the Atlantic Ocean. It is made up of two islands (Manhattan Island and Staten Island), part of an island (Brooklyn and Queens are on Long Island), and a small piece of the mainland (The Bronx), also many smaller islands. Water divides a lot of the city. The Hudson River forms the border between Manhattan and the Bronx and the State of New Jersey. The East River forms the border between Manhattan and Brooklyn and Queens. Newtown Creek is part of the border between Brooklyn and Queens. Some parts of the city are very separate from the others because of water, such as Far Rockaway in Queens and City Island in The Bronx. A small piece of land in Manhattan is international territory and it belongs to the United Nations to use for its buildings. New York City was made on the TV show Teen Titans and it was done for the movie Cloverfield. New York City currently has a population of about 8 million people. Over 18 million people live in the city and nearby areas. Most of the New York city population since the 1990s belongs to a US minority. Government. The current mayor of New York is Michael Bloomberg, an Independent. The city also has a City Council that makes some local laws. Most laws in New York City are set by the State government in Albany. Transportation. Subway transportation is provided by the New York City Subway system, one of the biggest in the world.",
   "One": "One (1) is a natural number after zero and before two. A human typically has one head, nose, mouth, and navel (or belly-button). The Roman numeral is I. Language. It is also a pronoun, as in, \"one says...\", \"one does...\". It is used in place of \"a person says...\" or \"an individual does...\". Mathematics. In mathematics, one is also the only number with this special fact: Any number multiplied by 1 equals that number. Then, the number 1 divides any number but it is not divided by any. The number 1 divides any number to give that same number but it cannot be divided by any other number to give one as the answer. Let \"n\" be any number. Then \"n\"/1 = \"n\" but 1/\"n\" is never 1.(When n is not 1) Example: 7/1 = 7 but 1/7 is not 1 but 0.142857... Any number divided by itself always gives 1 as the answer. \"n\"/\"n\" = 1.(When n is not 0) Example: 7/7 = 1. Computer science. The number one is important for computer science because it is together with Zero a part of the Binary numeral system. In Machine code and in Programming languages one means true. Zero means false.",
   "Orthography": "Orthography, or spelling, is the correct order and combination of letters put together to form words. Spelling changes over time. At about the time of the Renaissance, words in English didn't have a fixed spelling. Over time, however, different combinations of letters became more common, resulting in the more standard spellings of words we see today. Differences in American English and British English prove that spelling is not set in stone. In the early nineteenth century, Noah Webster set out to change American English forever. He wished to distinguish American English spelling from British English spelling. In Noah Webster's dictionary, \"practise\" became \"practice\", \"colour\" became \"color\", and \"centre\" became \"center\". In doing this, Webster created a new identity for American English. Some people argue which language is the easiest to spell. No language is hard or easy, but people who learn a second language think that their first (native) language is the easiest. Languages which are phonetic can be easier to learn to spell than others. Phonetic languages are pronounced exactly as they are spelled and are spelled exactly as they are pronounced. The Italian word \"orologio\" for instance is pronounced oh-ro-LO-jo (\"gi\" always making a \"j\" sound.) In English, one comes across the word \"knife\". In \"knife\", the \"k\" is not spoken, even though in English it's more common to pronounce \"K\"s when they are in words. The spelling of the English language can be difficult because English is made up of many different languages, like Anglo-Saxon (a Germanic language) and French (a Romanic language.) English, Spanish, French, German, and other languages use the Roman alphabet. Other languages, like Greek, Russian, and Arabic, use other alphabets.",
   "Oil": "The word oil is used for many different kinds of liquids. Oil usually does not mix with water. Some oils are made from plants and used in foods and for cooking. Some kinds of plant oils that people use are African oil palm, maize (\"corn\"), olive, peanut, soy, and sunflower. Other kinds of oil are made from crude oil (\"petroleum\") which comes from under the ground. People use large oil wells to bring the oil to the top of the ground. The oil is sent in special ships called tankers or in pipelines to factories called refineries where it is distilled into LPG, gasoline (\"petrol\"), diesel oil, and bitumen. Plastics are also normally made from crude oil. Oils from crude oil are also used as fuels for engines or to make the parts of machines work together without sticking or stopping. Different kinds of oils are also used for many other things, for example to make cosmetics, medicines, paints, and detergents, like washing up liquids. Soaps are similar to detergents, but they are generally made from animal fats rather than oils. There is also synthetic oil.",
   "OK": "OK is a word in the English language. It is used to mean that something is good or correct. It can often be used instead of the word Yes. It is also the two-letter abbreviation for the state of Oklahoma in the United States of America. It is not certain where the word \"OK\" originally comes from, but some experts say it came from a funny way of writing \"Ol Korrect\" (All correct). You also find the phrase \"Ola kala\" in Greek, which means something like \"Everything fine\" and it could stem from Ancient Greek. Some people think that the word comes from the war. When no soldiers have been killed, they used 0 Killed (OK)",
   "Operating system": "An operating system is what is needed to run the programs on a computer. It makes the link between programs and hardware. Windows and Mac OS X are popular operating systems. Less popular, but important, are operating systems like Linux, Unix, and Solaris. An operating system is a mixture of different parts: (these can change depending on the operating system) What an operating system does. Most casual computer users take their operating system for granted. The easiest way to understand what an operating system does is to take a close look at what computers were like before operating systmes were invented. The earliest electronic computers did not have any operating system. If the user wanted to change what the computer was doing, the user had to open the back panel on the (then very large) computer, and change how the wires were connected. Changing what the computer did was very time consuming and required an expert. Later, computer scientists decided that it was better to have the wires stay as they were, and feed instructions to the computer with punch cards or magnetic tape. The computer would store the instructions in some kind of memory. This way of operating a computer is called the von Neumann architecture. Still, computers of the time generally only had enough memory to \"remember\" one program at a time. If the user wanted the computer to run a different program, the user had to wipe out the first program from memory and then load another program into memory. Computer operators and computer scientists grew tired of carrying around large stacks of punch cards. They also wanted their computers to run more than one program at a time. As the memory capabilities of computers got better over the years, they decided that it would be better if the computer could hold several programs in its memory. The computer user could then simply choose which program they wanted to run. Running a computer this way requires a \"boss\" program that controls all the other program, and asks the user what program they want to run. Such a boss program is called an operating system. Having several progams in memory that can be run at any time presents some new problems. The operating system itself has to remember where the programs are at in memory. The operating system also has to prevent two programs from fighting over which one gets to use the processor. These days it is unthinkable to have a desktop computer without some kind of operating system. Operating systems generally start up automatically when the user turns on the computer.",
   "Profanity": "Profanity is the act of using rude words. The adjective is profane. Profanities can also be called swear words, curse (\"cuss\") words, dirty words, bad words, foul language, obscenity or obscene language, or expletives. It can be called an oath, although this word also has a normal meaning of a \"solemn promise\". Religious profanity is called blasphemy. The verb is to blaspheme and the adjective is blasphemous. Saying \u201cGod!\u201d or \u201cJesus Christ!\u201d as an expression of surprise or annoyance is considered by many people to be blasphemy, mostly because one of the Ten Commandments says not to use God's name \"in vain\" (without a good reason). Swearing oaths is also considered wrong by some who follow Jesus' teaching against swearing oaths in the Gospels (such as Matt. 5:34). A profanity usually refers to religion, sex, or bodily functions. These are things that people feel very strongly about. In some languages, such as French, there is more profanity about religion than most other topics. Russian has more about defecation and the lower digestive tract. A profanity can be a word or gesture or some other form of behaviour. Different words can be profanity to different people, and what words are thought of as profanity in English can change over time. Whether a word is a profanity will always depend on the way people think. Some people will be offended by something, while others are not. Words which should not be used are taboo words. Using such words is thought by some people to be a sin. Opinions on profanity. Some people call profanity \"crude,\" but some say that it is no cruder to say \"damn\" than \"puke\" (a word that is simply vulgar, but not a swear word). People who use profanity do not always mean to make anybody feel bad, and tolerance for different forms of profanity can vary widely, from person to person. Most often, using profanity is a verbal outlet for strong feelings (usually unpleasant ones), that might otherwise cause a physical reaction. At other times, some people may use profanity as humor. Coprolalia. Some people develop a mental condition where they use profanity constantly. This is called coprolalia. Many people wrongly think this is called Tourette's syndrome. Tourette's syndrome is actually a group of disorders that only includes coprolalia 15% of the time. The condition can be aggravated (made worse) by stress. Common examples of profanity. Several of these words come from Anglo-Saxon or Norse names for body parts, and bodily functions. They came to be thought of as profanity mostly after the Normans brought French and Latin words for them to England. Profane gestures. These are mostly performed while facing another person, and can be meant toward them, or about them. These gestures are considered as strong as profane words in most cases.",
   "Political party": "A political party is an organized group of voters. It often puts forward candidates for public office. In a democracy, leaders must \"run for office\" in an election. In a dictatorship, thhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/skins/common/images/button_media.png File linkere is generally only one party allowed, that can approve a new leader without non-members having a choice. About. A political party is similar to a faction, and can be the same thing. In some systems, members of one party in the legislature are all expected to vote the same way. The laws written by the party or faction with the majority of votes become adopted by the country, so this means whatever party is elected to over half the seats, gets to run the government. The next largest party is often called the \"opposition\". Sometimes when there are more than two parties with seats, no one party has over half of the seats. Then two or more parties might join together to form what is called a \"coalition\". Some parties are formed around a single issue or interest group. Others form policies to address all matters of government, known as a \"platform\". Many political parties have a set of ideas and beliefs (called its \"ideology\"). People often describe these ideologies using words such as \"rightwing\" and \"leftwing\". Common ideologies include environmentalism, socialism (ranging from social democracy to Marxism and Communism), conservatism, democracy, liberalism, and nationalism. The law. Political parties can be against the law in some places. When some parties get a lot of power, they can make all other political parties illegal. For example, the Nazi Party did this in Germany, and the Communist Party did it in several countries. Some countries make extreme-right parties illegal (such as Vlaams Blok in Belgium). At other times, countries have outlawed far-left parties. For example, West Germany banned the Communist Party in 1956. A handful of countries like China, North Korea and Cuba still have one-party dictatorships. In a few other dictatorships, such as Saudi Arabia, all political parties are banned and there is no parliament at all. Importance in all big democracies. In all big democratic countries, parties are very important. But there are a few very small countries, such as the island of Jersey, where most politicians don't belong to any party and where parties do not matter much. In some democracies, there are only two big political parties. For example, in the United States, there is the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Some other parties exist but are very small and do not hold seats in Congress. In other countries there are larger numbers of parties. In the German federal Parliament (or Bundestag), six parties have seats. In the United Kingdom, there are two big parties, one medium-sized party, and many small ones.",
   "Program": "The term Program can be used in many ways.",
   "Platonic realism": "Platonic realism (also called Platonism\" or Anti realism\") is the philosophical idea that one must try to know about perfect things, even though you know that they do not exist and may not be able to be understood. It is named after the philosopher Plato. Plato thought that goodness was part of reality, but was part of a parallel 'perfect' universe. Plato thought it was the job of the philosopher to look for reflections of these perfect things in our universe and to teach others about what they found. In philosophy of mathematics, someone is called a Platonist if they believe a mathematical proof is part of reality, but also that it is not part of our universe but a parallel 'perfect' one. Mathematical Platonists also believe that numbers are not related to things in our universe, and that even if there was never a group of one million things that the number one million would still be a real number. Some think this idea affects our ideas about money (economics) and our ideas of time. It is hard to say if this is true, since platonism is so basic in the Western culture. Plato and his student Aristotle had many ideas which are still the most important in this culture. It is hard to say if this one was critical. God's eye view may be more important, especially in politics. Today, Platonism is mostly considered a philosophy of mathematics but not of science or reality in general. This might under-estimate its effects. But no one calls themselves Platonist other than a few mathematicians today.",
   "Potato": "A potato is a kind of vegetable, or the vegetable that grows this fruit. It contains a lot of starch and other carbohydrates The potato plant grows well in many different parts of the world. It is a small plant with large leaves. The part of the potato that people eat grows under the ground. It usually has a brown or pink skin and is white or yellow inside. The potato is not very good to eat unless it is cooked. People cook potatoes by boiling, roasting, or frying them. French fries or \"chips\" are potatoes cut into long pieces and fried until they are soft. Potato chips or potato crisps are potatoes cut into very thin round pieces and fried until they are hard. The potato was first grown and eaten in the Andes Mountains of South America. When the Europeans came to South America, they brought the potato back to Europe. The scientific name of the potato plant is \"Solanum tuberosum\".",
   "Plant": "Plants are living things. Plants are not animals so they do not need to eat other living things to live. They are usually fixed to one location in the ground. Plants make food for themselves using sunlight, water, certain minerals (nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous), and carbon dioxide. They are one of five big groups (kingdoms) of living things. Plants grow upward. The heat from the sunlight pulls the water and food from the ground through the roots, and toward tiny holes at the other end of the plant. These little holes are mostly on the plant's leaves. This is called transpiration. The word \"plant\" can also mean to put something in the ground. For example, farmers plant seeds in the ground. Flowering plants. Plants need sunlight to grow green. If plants are grown without sunlight they turn yellow and grow tall. This is because they are looking for sunlight which boosts the plant's chlorophyll levels which, in turn, help it grow green. Plants generally produce flowers and flowers produce nice smells, unless they produce bad smells.",
   "Probability experiment": "A probability experiment is a situation where chance affects the outcome. A coin flip is a probability experiment because chance affects whether a coin will land heads or tails when it is flipped.",
   "Periodic table": "The periodic table of the chemical elements is a list of known atoms (chemical elements). In the table the elements are placed in the order of their atomic numbers starting with the lowest number. The atomic number of an element is the same as the number of electrons or protons in the atom. Doctor Laurence George Tyson mentions the air molecules. In the periodic table the elements are arranged into \"molecules\" and \"gangs\". A row of elements across the table is called a \"period\". Each period has a number: from 1 to 7. Period 1 has only 2 elements in it: hydrogen and helium. Period 2 and Period 3 both have 8 elements. Other periods are longer. A row of elements down the table is called a \"group\". There are 18 groups in the standard periodic table. Each group has a number: from 1 to 18. Elements in a group have electrons arranged in similar ways, which gives them similar chemical properties (they behave in similar ways). For example, group 18 is known as the noble gases because they are all gases and they do not combine with other atoms. The periodic table can be used by chemists to observe patterns, and relationships between the elements. For example, elements to the top and far left of the table are the most metallic, and elements on the bottom right are the least metallic. (e.g lithium is much more metallic than xenon). There are also many other patterns and relationships. There are three systems of group numbers; one using Arabic numerals (1,2,3) and the other two using Roman numerals (I, II, III). The Roman numeral names were used at first and are the traditional names; the Arabic numeral names are newer names that the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) decided to use as well. The IUPAC names were meant to replace the older Roman numeral systems as they used the same names to mean different things, which was confusing. The Periodic Table was invented and arranged by the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev (1834-1907). He got the idea from his favorite card game, Patience. Standard periodic table. Chemical Series of the Periodic Table State at standard temperature and pressure",
   "Planet": "A planet is a large object such as Earth or Jupiter that orbits a star. It is smaller than a star, and it does not make light. Planets are ball-shaped (spheres). Objects that orbit planets are called moons. There are eight planets in the Solar System. Pluto used to be known as a planet, but in August 2006, a group of astronomers decided it should be called a dwarf planet instead. There are four more known ice dwarfs, Ceres, Makemake, Eris and Haumea. The name \"planet\" is from the Greek word \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (\"planetes\"), meaning \"wanderers\", or \"things that move\". Until the 1990s, people only knew of those in the Solar System. As of January 2007, we know of 209 other planets. All of the newly found planets are orbiting other stars: they are \"extrasolar\" planets. Sometimes people call them \"exoplanets\". In the Solar System. The planets in the Solar System have names of Greek or Roman gods, apart from Earth, because people did not think Earth was a planet in old times. However, Earth is occasionally referred by the name of a Roman god: \"Terra\". Other languages, for example Chinese, use different names. Moons also have names of gods and people from classical mythology, or from the plays of Shakespeare. Planets. Here is a list of planets in the Solar System. They are ordered by how close they are to the Sun, nearest first. Types of planets. Astronomers speak about \"major\" (or true) planets, and minor planets, which are smaller objects that go around the Sun. Some examples of \"minor planets\" are asteroids, comets, and trans-Neptunian objects. Many objects in the Solar System that are not planets are also \"icy\". Examples are the icy moons of the outer planets of the Solar System (like Triton).",
   "Pluto": "orbit: 5,913,520,000 km (39.5 AU) from the Sun (average) Pluto is a dwarf planet in our Solar System. It is made of rock and ice. It is very cold on Pluto with temperatures between -218\u00b0C (about -360 Fahrenheit) and -240\u00b0C (-400 Fahrenheit). Pluto is 2390 kilometres across, which is about two-thirds as wide as the Moon and about one fifth as wide as the Earth. Pluto is thirteen million tonnes in mass. The Earth has about 460 times the mass of Pluto. The Moon has about five and a half times the mass of Pluto. Clyde Tombaugh found Pluto in 1930. Pluto was named after the Roman god of hell. This name was suggested by Venetia Burney from England. She was eleven years old at the time. Others say it was named using the initials of Percival Lowell, the scientist who had computed its position in the sky years before Pluto actual discovery. Pluto has three moons: Charon, Nix, and Hydra. Charon is 1190 km across, half as wide as Pluto. Charon is about 19,410 km away from Pluto. Pluto and Charon spin around each other making the two look like a double dwarf planet. Nix and Hydra are much smaller, about 45-160 km across, about 44,000 km from Pluto. Charon was found in June 1978 and Nix and Hydra were found in June 2005. There are eight planets in the Solar System. Pluto is very different from these eight planets. It is smaller than them and follows a different kind of path around the Sun. Pluto sometimes gets closer to the Sun than Neptune, because of the path it follows. Mercury is the Solar System's smallest planet. Mercury is about twice as wide as Pluto. Mercury has about twenty-five times the mass of Pluto. Pluto used to the ninth planet of the solar system. However, in August 2006 the International Astronomical Union said that Pluto should not be called a planet anymore. They said that it should be called a dwarf planet instead. This is because Pluto is very different from the other eight planets, and does not completely fill the accepted scientific definition of a proper planet.",
   "Pi": "pi is the number found when the distance around a circle (the circumference) is divided by the distance between opposite ends of the circle (the diameter). The value of pi is around 3.141592654. A common fraction approximation of pi is formula_3, which yields 3.14285714. This approximation has an error of about 0.04%. While this approximation is sufficient for most applications, the fraction formula_4 is more accurate (giving 3.14159292), and can be used when a more precise calculation is needed. Pi is often written as the Greek letter \u03c0. Pi is an irrational number, meaning it cannot be written as a fraction (formula_5). This basically means that pi goes on forever, and that it is impossible to get pi exactly. However, it is very useful in many ways, not just measuring circles. Mathematicians have known about pi for thousands of years. The first known approximations of pi are from around 1900 BC, and are 25/8 (by the Babylonians) and 256/81 (by the Egyptians). The most common way of finding pi has been to inscribe (draw) a shape of many sides in a circle, and use the area of the polygon to find out pi. These polygons could range from 96 sides (as used by Archimedes) to more than 16,384 sides (as used by the ancient Chinese in around 500 AD.)And also it is used to work out the area and the circumference of a circle. The formula for the circumference is C(circumference)= pi times diameter. The formula for finding the area of a circle is pi (radius\u00b2). Pi in real life. Today, there are are different ways to calculate many digits of formula_2. This is of limited use though.",
   "Proper noun": "A proper noun is a noun that has the first letter capitalized. Names of places and people are proper nouns.",
   "Plastic": "A plastic is a material that can change its shape, so many things can be made of plastic. There are many types of plastic. Some can be shaped only when they are freshly made; then they become hard afterwards. Others can be changed by heating them up or even by melting them. Most plastics are man-made; they do not occur in nature. They are often made from oil that comes out of the ground. The process of making plastics is usually quite complicated. Most of the materials that are called \"plastic\" are polymers. Polymers are long chains of atoms bonded to one another. People experimented with plastics based on natural polymers for a very long time. Alexander Parkes, an English inventor (1813-1890), created the earliest fom of plastic in 1855. It was hard but flexible and transparent, and he called it \"Parkensine.\" Plastic is filling up the landfills and sometimes if you burn them, they release toxic fumes. If you don't recycle, it becomes waste.",
   "Quebec": "Quebec (spelled Qu\u00e9bec in French) is a province in Eastern Canada. It is the biggest of Canada's ten provinces. It is the province with the second-highest number of people. Most of Quebec's inhabitants live along or close to the banks of the Saint Lawrence River. Not many people live in the north part of the province. Unlike the other provinces, most people in Quebec speak French. There is a strong French-language culture, which includes French-language newspapers, magazines, television and radio shows, and movies. The government of Quebec has its offices in the capital, Quebec City, one of the oldest cities in North America. The largest city in Quebec, and the second-largest city in Canada, is Montreal. Quebec has a lot of natural resources that are used to create jobs. Quebec also has many companies that create products for information and communication technologies, aerospace, biotechnology, and health industries. It has also developed close relations with the Northeastern United States. Leaving Canada. Quebec was part of New France until 1760. Quebec became a province in the Canadian Confederation in 1867. Since then, some people in Quebec have wanted to leave Canada. Since Quebec is a mainly French-speaking province, many people there feel that it is very different from the rest of Canada, and they are proud of this difference and want to keep it that way. Some feel that for this to happen, Quebec must leave Canada and become its own country. Others feel that it is important for Quebec to stay a part of Canada. Quebec people held democratic votes in 1980 and 1995 to decide whether to leave Canada. In 1995, the people of Quebec voted on the question, and chose to stay in Canada by a one percent margin. Motto: \"Je me souviens\" (I remember) History of Quebec. Aboriginal people and Inuit groups were the first peoples who lived in what is now Qu\u00e9bec. These Aboriginal people lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing. Some of the Aboriginal people, called Iroquoians, planted squash and maize. The Inuit fish and hunt whales and seals for fur and food, and they sometimes warred with each other. Vikings came in longboats from Scandinavia in 1000 CE. Basque whalers and fishermen traded furs with Aboriginal people throughout the 1500s. The first French explorer to reach Quebec was Jacques Cartier. He sailed into the St. Lawrence River in 1535 and established a colony near present-day Quebec City. Samuel de Champlain came from France and traveled into the St. Lawrence River. In 1608, he founded Quebec City as a permanent fur trading outpost. Champlain signed trading and military agreements with the Aboriginal people. Voyageurs, coureurs des bois, and Catholic missionaries used river canoes to explore the interior of the North American continent. After 1627, King Louis XIII of France made a rule that only Roman Catholics could go to live in New France. Jesuit clerics tried to convert New France's Aboriginal people to Catholicism. New France became a Royal Province of France in 1663. The population grew from about 3,000 to 60,000 people between 1666 and 1760. Colonists built farms on the banks of St. Lawrence River. In 1753 France began building a series of forts in the British Ohio Country. Britain asked the French to remove the forts, and the French refused. By 1756, France and Britain were at war. In 1758, the British attacked New France by sea and captured the French fort at Louisbourg. On 1759, British General James Wolfe defeated General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm outside Quebec City. France gave its North American land to Great Britain in 1763. In 1763, New France was renamed the Province of Quebec. In 1774, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act giving recognition to French law, Catholic religion and French language in the colony. The Quebec Act gave the Quebec people their first Charter of rights. The Quebec Act made American colonists angry, so they launched the American Revolution. A 1775 invasion by the American Continental Army was stopped at Quebec City. In 1783, Quebec gave the territory south of the Great Lakes to the new United States of America. In 1867 the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the British North America Act, which brought most of the provinces together. Quiet Revolution. The conservative government of Maurice Duplessis dominated Quebec politics from 1944 to 1960 with the support of the Catholic church. The Quiet Revolution was a period of social and political change. During the Quiet Revolution, English Canadians lost their control over the Quebec economy, the Roman Catholic Church became less important, and the Quebec government took over the hydro-electric companies. in 1963, a terrorist group that became known as the Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ) began doing bombings, robberies and attacks on government offices. In 1970, the FLQ kidnapped and killed James Cross, the British trade commissioner to Canada, and Pierre Laporte, a provincial minister and Vice-Premier. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau invoked the War Measures Act, and 497 people were arrested. This was called the Quiet Revolution because there was not a whole bunch of protests. In 1977, the newly elected Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government of Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque introduced the Charter of the French Language. Often known as Bill 101, it defined French as the only official language of Quebec.",
   "Religion": "Religion is a word for the ideas about the basic structure of the world that people cannot see or know with our other senses, or that scientists cannot study with machines. There are many different religions in the world. Religions try to answer important but mysterious questions like \"Where did the world come from?\" and \"What happens to us after we die?\" When people believe that they have answers to these questions, they often start new religions, or add their new ideas to old religions. Many religions believe in supernatural beings such as spirits, angels, devils, polytheistic gods, or a monotheistic god, who can influence people and the world. People who teach or write about religion often say that they got their ideas from a supernatural being. Many religions are very old, but new religions are always being created when some people aren't satisfied with the answers from the old religions. Things which are considered important and good by religions are called sacred or holy. Many religions have sacred books that give the most important ideas and stories of their religions. Religions often teach how they believe people should behave in order to live happily together and/or to please God. Many religions believe that people who live in the right way will go to a pleasant place, or (heaven), after they die, or that people who live in a wrong way will go to a bad place, or (hell). How long one stays in these places depends on which belief system is asked. Hindus and Buddhists believe in temporary heavens and hells, where people go for being either extremely righteous or extremly evil, before uniting with God. Christians and Muslims, on the other hand, believe that heaven and hell are eternal states. Some religions believe in the \"Resurrection\" - that God will bring some, most or all dead people alive again one day; while other religions believe in \"Reincarnation\" - that people will be born again as a new person or as an animal after they die. Usually this is believed to be according to how a person acts in their previous life. Some religions believe a mixture of all of these ideas. Most religions teach people to be good and to help each other, but unfortunately religions also sometimes create problems. This is partly because the questions of religion are so important to people, and because it is difficult to be sure which answers are correct. Many people are unhappy when other people do not agree with their ideas about religion, or when they think that people will cause problems for their religion. When this happens, people sometimes make wars against people of other religions, or punish people who do not agree with their ideas about religion. This has happened many times in history, and continues to happen today. At other times, wars have been begun for more selfish reasons that had really nothing to do with religion, but in order to win more support for these wars, the kings or politicians would try hard to make it seem to be about religion, or would give the people a supposedly 'religious' reason for fighting a war. Many religions build buildings for their people to meet. In different religions, these buildings may be called churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, pathis, or shrines. Many of the oldest, most beautiful, and most famous buildings are religious buildings. Opposed to any form of religion is atheism, its argumentation can be support by such conceptions like Law of three stages \"See List of religions for more.\"",
   "Roman": "The Romans are the people of the city of Rome in Italy. In ancient times the people of the city of Rome created a very large empire called the Roman Empire.",
   "River": "A river is a stream of water that flows through a \"channel\" (or passage) in the surface of the ground. The passage where the river flows is called the riverbed and the earth on each side is called a riverbank. A river begins on high ground or in hills or mountains and flows down from the high ground to the lower ground, because of gravity. A river begins as a small stream and gets bigger, the further that it flows. The water in a river is called \"fresh water\". It comes from rain or snow and it can usually be drunk safely, unless it has been polluted. The water in a sea cannot be drunk safely because it is \"salt water\". Both people and animals often live near rivers, because they need water to survive. The beginning of a river. The beginning of a river is called its \"source\" or its \"headwaters\". The part of the river that is near the \"source\" is called a \"young river\". A young river is often in a V-shaped river bed, and flows quickly downhill over stones, and around big rocks. Young rivers often have lots of small waterfalls. The middle part of a river. The middle part of a river is called a \"mature river\". A mature river makes a riverbed that is U-shaped. It might be very deep and run fast. It sweeps over small rocks and bolders, and makes big turns around hills and mountains. It is much wider than a \"young river\", but not as wide as an \"old river\". To cross over a mature river, people use bridges. Many cities and towns are built on the banks of mature rivers. Many farms that keep animals such as dairy cows, horses and sheep are found along mature rivers because the animals can drink from the river every day. The last part of a river. A river usually ends by flowing into an ocean, a lake or a bigger river. The place where the river flows out into a bigger body of water is called the \"mouth\" of the river. As a river flows towards its mouth, the countryside around the river often changes from hilly to flat. As it flows over the flat land the river becomes wider and slower. A wide slow river is called an \"old river\". An \"old river\" often floods across the land after there is lots of rain at the \"headwaters\". An \"old river\" slowly builds up its banks on either side; the high banks are called \"levees\". An old river often \"meanders\" (twists and turns), and sometimes, after a flood, it leaves lakes behind which are called \"ox-bows\" or \"billabongs\". Old rivers are the most useful type of river for growing crops. Corn, rice, fruit, cotton, hay, tobacco and sugar are some of the crops that are grown near old rivers. Where a river flows out to the sea, it sometimes flows very slowly through sandy or muddy land, making lots of little islands as it flows. The main stream of the river gets broken into many parts that spread out into a triangle shape like the Greek letter \"Delta\". When this happens, it is called the \"delta\" of the river. Deltas are often places that are not good for towns or farms but are very good for birds and other wildlife. Deltas are often made into wildlife reserves. Not all rivers have deltas. There are famous deltas on the Nile River, the Amazon River, the Mekong River and the Danube River. Using rivers. The water in rivers is \"fresh water\" that has come from rain, snow and from underground streams. It can be drunk safely by people unless it is too dirty because of mud or human pollution. People and animals need fresh water to drink, so they often live by the side of a river.",
   "Right angle": "A right angle is an angle with a measurement of 90 degrees. When two lines cross each other so that all the angles have the same size, the result is four right angles. The top of the letter T is at right angles to the vertical line. Walls of buildings are usually at right angles to the floor. Two things that are at right angles are called \"perpendicular\".",
   "Ranch": "A ranch is a large farm where animals such as cows, horses or sheep are raised. A ranch is often on private land. The word ranch is from the Spanish word \"rancho\". Ranches are often found in the desert regions of Australia because of the plenty of available space.",
   "Sport utility vehicle": "A sport utility vehicle (SUV) is a type of vehicle that can carry lots of passengers, like a station wagon or minivan. Appearence. SUVs are shaped like a big station wagon. However, they are taller, because the seats are more upright and because they have a taller suspension so that they can go off road. (However, less than 10 percent of these vehicles actually do go off road.) Another way that many SUVs are different from some regular cars is that many SUVs have four-wheel-drive, but most regular cars only have two-wheel-drive. Also, many SUVs have larger engines, like a six- or an eight-cylinder engine. In some countries, SUVs often have diesel engines. Design. SUVs come from designs that were originally military or commercial, such as the Jeep and the Land Rover. These vehicles have been popular for many years with rural people because they can go off-road, but now they are also popular with people in urban areas because they believe that they look good. Modern designing. Consequently, newer SUVs are more like cars because buyers like it that way. Instead of buying a car they buy a SUV that's designed like a car. They have luxury features and more car-like suspensions and ride heights. This is because most of these newer SUVs seldom go off-road, but stay on the street most of the time. Uses. However, some people do take their SUVs off the road to explore places that they could not go with a car, and to enjoy the driving. Because of this, there are many off-road clubs in different countries. SUVs are even raced, such as in the Paris-Dakar Rally and the Australian Safari. Also, there are many fun things you can do with a SUV. For example, you can tow a boat with an SUV. Advantages. There are many reasons why SUVs have become popular. One reason is the comfort of their large cabins--they can carry almost as much as a minivan. Another reason is that people think they are safe. Image. Finally, a major reason why they are popular is that they have a rugged, powerful image. People buy them because they look good, even though a small car might be less expensive and more practical. Automobile companies have sold many SUVs. They make more profit on them per vehicle than with other automobiles, because they are cheaper and simpler to build than many passenger cars of equivalent price. Problems. Many people have bought SUVs, but now many people do not like them anymore, because SUVs are bad for the environment and dangerous to other drivers. In addition, these people think that the SUVs are not really as safe as people believe they are. Accidents. One problem with SUVs is that they roll over more easily than lower vehicles. In recent years Consumer Reports magazine found several SUVs unacceptable because they roll over too easily. Also, they are big and stiff, and they have high bumpers, so when they hit another car, the other car and its passengers can be severely damaged. Big, heavy SUVs like Ford Excursions and Chevrolet Suburbans can damage cars badly when they hit them. Huge gasoline consumption. SUVs have become so popular in the United States that the U.S. is using much more gasoline than before. SUVs are much less fuel-efficient than cars. The main reason is that the U.S. government classifies them as small trucks, so they do not have to be as fuel efficient as passenger cars. Since auto companies have little reason to change SUVs, they are fuel-inefficient. They are big and heavy, have a lot of wind resistance, and have big engines and a heavy suspension. They also use tires that are better for off road than for driving on the street. Smaller SUVs that look like cars may be shorter and use better tires, but they still have big, fuel-inefficient, polluting engines. Other names. In Australia and Europe SUVs are usually called 4 wheel drives (4X4)or 4WDs.",
   "Substance": "Substance [\"sub'-stuns\"] is the material, or \"matter\", of which something is made. Substances can be seen or touched. They are made up of one or more elemental parts. Iron, aluminium, water and air are examples of substances.",
   "Symbol": "A symbol is a drawing, shape, or object that represents an idea, object, or amount of something. The most common symbols are letters, which are symbols of words and sounds. A symbol can be an actual object, such as the crucifix (a symbol of Christianity) and the scepter (which symbolizes royalty and power). Symbols can even be colors or patterns. Symbols are used often in poetry and other types of literature, most often used as metaphors or similes. A national emblem is a symbol for a certain country. List of common symbols. There are thousands of symbols that are recognized by most people all over the world, and many more that are limited to certain regions, religions, sciences, etc.. Some of the best known ones are listed below.",
   "September": "September is the ninth month of the year with 30 days. From the Latin word \"sept\" for \"seven\" (it was the seventh month of the year, before January and February were moved at the beginning of the year). September begins on the same day of week as December every year. In Ancient Greece, September was called \"Boedromion\". September's flower is the Aster with the birthstone being the Sapphire. The meaning of the Sapphire is Love.",
   "Society": "Society is the term to describe human beings together (collective, the sum of their social networks and power networks). It does not refer to everything everybody thinks or does, but only to those things that everybody acts upon - or refuses to do - quite reliably. Because it must keep even the poorest and weakest members of a society willing to help even the richest and strongest, a society is very concerned with citizenship, rights, ethics and time limits. These are basic ways to achieve fairness. If they break down badly, people will think the society is unfair and start taking things from each other, refusing to help each other, or seeing those who have more as cheats. While every society is different, the way it breaks down and fails is very often the same: fraud, theft, violence, war and sometimes even genocide if people stop identifying with the society and thus identify with what they think of as a \"race\" of people. A new society may be formed out of only those who still agree, or who just survive the collapse of an old failed one. If the strength and unity of any society's members' willingness to help each other is to be measured, it is called social capital, because it substitutes for other styles of capital. One needs less money with more solidarity in society, because the collective substitutes for the currency. However, usually, the strength is not directly measured, but only assumed. People take risks that society will support them, without knowing for sure that it will. For instance, they may refuse to obey the law, and count on their fellow society members to free them in a jury or court of appeal. A social contract sets out rules for this kind of cooperation. One kind of social contract is a constitution - which allows for a jury or court to decide that the law, not the person, is wrong, according to the society's rules.",
   "Suggestion": "A suggestion is an idea that one suggests, or says is good for another (or others) to follow.",
   "Spache Readability Formula": "Spache Readability Formula is one method of finding out how hard a piece of writing is (its textual difficulty). The method compares words in a text to a list of words which are familiar in everyday writing. The words that are not on the list are called \"unfamiliar\". The number of words per sentence are counted. This number and the percentage of unfamiliar words is put into a formula. The result is a reading age. Someone of this age should be able to read the text. Spache works best on texts that are for children under the age of eight. the formula; (0.141 * average sentence length)+(0.086 * percentage of difficult words)+0.839 = grade level GL = (.121 * ASL) + (.082 *UW) +.659 UW = Number of unique unfamiliar words",
   "Sport": "A sport is an activity that has rules and usually requires physical activity, like running. Sports can keep people active and healthy. They can be played indoors or outdoors.",
   "Science": "Science is a way to find out things. Sometimes the word \"science\" is used to refer to the knowledge that is found using the methods of science. The word \"science\" is from the Latin word \"scio\", which means \"to know\". People who do science are called scientists. Scientists study things by looking at them very carefully, by measuring them, and by doing experiments and tests. Scientists try to explain why things act the way they do, and are the way they are. Scientific method. The \"scientific method\" is the name given to the methods used in science to learn and experiment with things. The scientific method can be very useful. Most people accept the scientific method as the most reliable way to get knowledge about nature, the universe, and the human body. Other features of science. Not everyone agrees about how science works exactly. Some philosophers and scientists say that scientific theories are only accepted as long as they are the best explanation for the data that exists, and when theories no longer explain the data, they are discarded and replaced. Other people say that sometimes scientists will make a theory better rather than discard it, or that they will keep on using the theory hoping that it will be made better eventually. Scientists compete with each other. Scientists check each other's work. Scientists try to make better explanations for the data. Scientists publish their work in peer-reviewed journals. Science is a way to get knowledge by discarding what is not true. Scientists must be very careful to make explanations that fit well with what they observe and measure. They compete to provide better explanations. An explanation might be interesting or pleasing, but if it does not agree with what other scientists really see and measure, they will try to find a better explanation. Other scientists check their ideas to see if the real observations, measurements, and tests show if they are right or wrong. Peer review and repeating experiments is the only way to be sure the knowledge is correct. Science makes models of nature, models of our universe, and medicine. There are many different sciences with their own names. However it is not right to say \"science says\" any one thing. Science is a process, not just the facts and rules believed at one time.",
   "Sausage": "Sausage is a food made of ground-up or chopped-up meat. It often has spices in it and is covered in a casing. Other meats, like the hot dog, pepperoni, bologna, and salami also are covered with a casing like a sausage's. Sausages often have meat from the animal's head, lips, cheeks, and other parts. Some have blood in them. Irish and English sausages normally have a lot of \"rusk,\" or bread crumbs, and they are less meaty than sausages from other countries. Sausages may be used as a meal, in a sandwich, or in other foods like stews. Many countries and regions have special kinds of sausage. Sausages are some of the oldest foods.",
   "Social contract": "A social contract is an agreement to follow certain rules. These rules are usually called laws. Laws help to make sure people have rights and that their rights are taken care of. One kind of social contract is a constitution. A constitution sets limits on the powers of government leaders, police, and other people who have authority.",
   "Site": "A site is a real fixed physical location where something will or has happened or a place where something is. Uses in buildings. It is used very often in building trades to mean the place where a building will go up. Uses in gravesites. A gravesite is a place where a person will be buried after they die. Uses in work. The words onsite and offsite refer to work that must take place on the site, or which can take place somewhere else. For instance, a prefabricated building can be \"built offsite\" and then \"moved onsite\". Use on the internet. \"Site\" is also a common abbreviation in net jargon for \"website\". In this case no real physical location exists other than the place where the computers are, and one \"goes to the site\" simply by using a web browser to \"go to\" that URL. This is a conceptual metaphor. It can be confusing. Someone who uses it is also likely using other jargon.",
   "Scientist": "A scientist is a person who works in science. A scientist tries to understand how our world, or other things work. About. Scientists work for governments, companies, schools and research institutes. Some scientists teach at universities and other places and train people to become scientists. Types of scientists. Scientists can work in different areas of science.",
   "Spirit": "In many religions, a spirit is considered to be the part of a being that is not the body. Other words with the same meanings are soul and ghost. When a body is alive, it has a spirit in it. Death is when the spirit separates from the body. Some people think that without their bodies, spirits can still exist on the Earth and in places like Heaven or Hell. Some believe that spirits can talk with people, or change things in the world. Many religions forbid communicating with such spirits in any way, but a few include this as part of their practice. Another use of \"spirit\" means the main purpose or meaning of a sentence or document. For example, the \"spirit of a law\" is the meaning of the law which the creator wanted. This phrase is often used when the words and sentences of a law could mean more than one thing, but a judge must decide what meaning is correct.",
   "Skin": "Skin is the outside covering of animals. The skin of different kinds of animals is very different. Many kinds of animals have hair or fur on their skin. Birds have feathers on their skin. Most fish, and reptiles like snakes and lizards, have scales on their skin. The skin of human beings (people) usually has very small hairs on it that are hard to see. Some people have more hair, or hair that is easier to see, and some have less. People have hair that is longer and easier to see on some parts of their bodies, such as the tops of their heads and men's beards. The skin of animals can be made into leather. Leather is sometimes used to make shoes, bags, and balls. Other things can be said to have \"skins\". People often say that fruits, such as apples and bananas, and vegetables, such as potatoes, have \"skins\".",
   "Shabbat": "The Shabbat day(also known sa the Sabbath Day) has its origins in Creation, when God made the Earth for six days, and stopped work on the seventh day. The Shabbat day starts Friday evening when the sun goes down, until Saturday night. According to Kabbalah, the Shabbat day is meant to be like a perfect world in which everyone knows about God and loves Him, a kind of world that has not been since the Garden of Eden, and will not be again until the Messiah comes. On Shabbat, work is not allowed according to the Ten Commandments. It is a day of rest and of Torah study. Most machines may not be used, and no work done. Not even a light switch can be used, according to Orthodox Judaism, but not all Jewish groups do this. The Sabbath in Christianity comes from the Jewish Shabbat, but most Christians have it on Sunday, not Saturday. They also rest, but not the same way as Jews. The exact way depends on denomination. Islam also has a Day of Rest, which also comes from Shabbat. In Islam it is on Friday, and is called \"Yawm al-Jamme'a,\" the \"Day of Gathering\" (For prayer).",
   "Speed": "Speed is the distance that an object moves in a certain amount of time. Speed is a measure of how fast something is moving. Finding speed. To find speed formula_1, formula_2formula_3 where formula_4 is the distance and formula_5 is the time that has gone by. Units of measurement for speed. There are many units of measurement for speed. For example, an object's speed can be measured in Changing speed. When an object changing speed, it gets faster or slower. When the object becomes faster, and the speed increases, it is called acceleration. When the object gets slower, and the speed decreases, it is called deceleration, or negative acceleration.",
   "Server": "In net jargon (words people use about the Internet) a server is a computer that serves many things from user, or client machines. Usually a server will only do a few things. Every type of thing a server does is called a service. Services are used by other computers that are called clients. The relationship between the client and the server is called a client-server relationship. For example, Wikipedia has a web server which has a service for sending web pages over the Internet. Your client computer talks to the Wikipedia's web page service to get web pages for you. So that servers and clients can talk to each other, they need to be connected to a network, and they need to use the same protocol. In networks, a protocol is a set way for machines to talk to other machines - like a language. For example, the Wikipedia server runs the HTTP (Hyper-text transfer protocol) to send web sites to your computer, and your computer uses the HTTP Protocol to ask Wikipedia for pages. Usually, servers are specially made to be more powerful and reliable, and they are more expensive than normal computers. Sometimes, servers can be clustered, which means that lots of servers work together to do one service. In a peer to peer system, every computer is both a client and a server to each other. This is commonly implemented in file sharing and VOIP. However, this can aid in attempts at piracy.",
   "State": "There are different forms of government a state can have,for example a republic, or a monarchy. Sometimes, states form their own countries, sometimes many states work together to form a country. Most states also have armed forces, civil service, law and police. Early states. The earliest states were just groups of power. A group of farms working together or a group of factories working together could be 'states' since people can control them and protect them. More organized states could be the monarchies such as early Egypt under the Pharaoh. Following this were larger more military-based states such as the Roman Empire. The most important early states, however, were the Ancient Greek states which had freedom, writing and a democracy. From military to modern state. When the military-based state, the Roman Empire, fell, lots of little states were made and each was also military-based and controlled by a king. These states didn't often work together and war raged. However, once people within the state itself started fighting (what's called a Civil war), the kings had to make peace and start parliaments. Modern states. These states all tried to improve their politics and economy and became more and more like the states today. They formed proper boundaries for their lands and worked with power within the state itself more, such as the Church or the nobility. They made armies, tax systems and embassies all to help make them more powerful and stable. Different types of state. Types of state can be separated into two categories: democracy and dictatorship. However, just because a group of states are all democratic does not mean that they follow the same rules. Iran, Pakistan, France, Germany and the United States of America are all states. Each of them sees itself as a democracy. Each of them however has a different idea what \"democracy\" really means. Different states of the same 'category' can also function differently. For example, two democratic states may be quite different if one has a well-trained police or army while the other does not. Therefore, the word 'state' only tells us what type of government that state follows (democratic or dictatorship) and doesn't tell us about the country itself. Sub-categories of state. There are lots of sub-types of state branching off from democracy and dictatorship. The main ones are Pluralism, Marxism and Institutionalism. Pluralism. Pluralism has been very popular in the United States. It shows the state as a neutral place for settling arguments between other states. Pluralism tells us that all people are not equal, but still allows each group of people to tell the state what to do. This type of state is called a polyarchy. Also in a pluralist state, politics, the military and the economy are all united and work together. This means that all power in the state is 'diffused' across the people who live there. Marxism. Marxism was popular in Europe in the 1960s and 1970s. It was started by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Marxism rejects the idea that a state is there for all the people living in it, and is definitely not a neutral place for settling arguments. The main job of a Marxist state is to protect capitalist-made profits and to help people make contracts to keep economy in the state fair. This is a good idea, however, the person who makes the money by using production or contracts has power over the people who don't make as much money as him. This means that the working class (the people who work in factories etc) have hardly any power but the people who own the factories have a lot of power. Basically, instead of giving power to everyone such as a polyarchy would do, only a small part of the people have power. Institutionalism. Both Marxism and Pluralism states have to react to the activities of groups of people in the state itself. Institutionalist states don't see themselves as 'instruments' to be controlled, they are more just geographical areas. In this area, the people just form groups themselves. An Institutionalist state can be made up of both Marxist and Pluralist people, both which have the power to control themselves and not influence the other parties of the state. Anarchism. Anarchism is when a group of people have complete freedom and don't believe in having a state at all. Anarchists are a lot like Marxists, since they don't believe that all people are equal, but they believe (opposite to Marxists) that a country can work without any organizations in it. Law and order are not necessary. Anarchists (such as Bakunin and Kropotkin in the 19th century), often want a form of Marxism but ignoring some of their rules. They want workers to manage themselves and simply get paid for what they do, rather than getting paid in wages.",
   "Solar System": "The Solar System is the astronomical name for the Sun and the collection of planets, comets and other objects moving around it. The Earth moves around the Sun in an oval shaped, or \"elliptical\" orbit. The other planets in the Solar System also move around the Sun in elliptical orbits. The biggest objects that go around the Sun are called planets. It took people many years of looking carefully through telescopes to find them. No new big ones have been found for a long time, but more small objects are found every year. Most of the planets have moons that orbit around them. There are 166 of these moons in the solar system. planets of solar system. The planets are numbered (1) to (8) in order of distance from the sun and dwarf planets are letter \"(A)\" to \"(E)\". Structure. There are a few main parts of the Solar System. The terrestrial inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars) are the four closest planets to the sun and all have rocky surface. Between Mars and Jupiter is the asteroid belt and after that are the Gas Giants, (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune). They are all bigger than Earth and are mostly made up of gas. This group are the four biggest planets in the Solar System. After them is another, larger asteroid belt called the Kuiper belt. This contains many comets and asteroids as well as the dwarf planets Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris. After this scientists think there may be an even bigger asteroid belt called the Oort cloud although since it is hard to see they cant be sure. Pluto is no longer a planet. Pluto has been called a planet since it was discovered in 1930. In 2006, astronomers decided Pluto should no longer be called a planet because it is too small. Also, its orbit is very different from the other eight planets, as its orbit slants a little. It is now called a dwarf planet along with four others Ceres, Haumea, Eris and Order of discovery. Before the discovery of Uranus, ancient thoughts of the solar system consisted only of the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn as much as ancient records go. Long ago, ancient scientists thought the Sun (and the whole solar system) orbited the Earth and that Venus was a star and not a planet.",
   "Slavery": "Slavery (also called thralldom) is a system where people, called slaves, must work with little or no pay for their work. Slaves do not have rights and have no choice but to work. Slavery is a form of unfree labour and, in general, slaves are owned by someone else. If a slave is owned by someone else, he is called a chattel slave (pronounced. Chattel slaves are property, much like cattle. They are bought and sold in the same way. Slavery today. People are still being made slaves in some parts of the world. The ways in which it is done have changed. Today, slaves work because of things like a high debt (for example, slaves have to work to pay off a debt). For girls and women, forced prostitution is a type of slavery. Another form of slavery still happening today is forced child labor. Some children have to work in mines or in plantations, or they have to fight wars as child soldiers, for no pay. One study says that there are 27 million people (but others say there could be as many as 200 million) in slavery today, everywhere. Countries. There is obvious enslavement still taking place in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. In Summer 2007, 570 people were found to be slaves for brick makers in China. Of those freed, 69 of them were children. The Chinese government made a force of 35,000 police check northern Chinese brick kilns for slaves, and sent lots of kiln supervisors and officials to prison and sentenced one kiln foreman to death for killing an enslaved worker. In Mauritania, it is estimated that up to 600,000 men, women and children, or 20% of the population, are enslaved, many of them used as bonded labour. Slavery in Mauritania was made illegal in August 2007. In Niger, slavery is also rife. A Nigerian study has found that more than 800,000 people are enslaved, almost 8% of the population. Child slavery has commonly been used when making cash crops and mining. According to the U.S. Department of State, more than 109,000 children were working on cocoa farms alone in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) in 'the worst forms of child labour' in 2002. Slave policy. The prices for a slave are different in different places. They start at about US$40, in Mali, for young adult male workers. A young woman or a girl who does not have HIV may sell for as much as US$1,000 in Thailand. In 1850 in the United States, a slave could have been US$1,000 \u2014 about $25,800 today. The change in price is probably due to the fact of today's greater population, making human life cheaper. As a result of the lower price, the money advantages of present-day slavery are clear. In November 2006, the International Labour Organisation said that it would prosecute members of the junta that rules Myanmar (also called Burma) at the International Court of Justice for \"Crimes against Humanity\". This is because the military obliges some citizens to forced labour. The International Labour Organisation says that it thinks that about 800.000 people are forced to work this way. Stopping slavery. Slavery was a very normal thing more than 150 years ago, but now most people know it is wrong, and most countries do not allow it. In 1833 Britain stopped slavery, then in 1865 the United States did the same. They made it a crime to own slaves. In the United States, it stopped after the American Civil War. When the North won, all slaves were made free. When that happened, it was called \"abolition of slavery\". Slavery still exists today in some countries.",
   "Soul": "Many philosophies and religions say that a soul is the part of a living human being which is supernatural and lives after death. It cannot be discovered by science, because it cannot be tested in any controlled way. Many different opinions exist as to what happens to personal experience after death. Most atheists say that there is no such thing as a soul, and that the body is the only part of a person. Popular culture. In popular culture, soul usually means deep feeling and commitment. It is in this sense that the word appears in the term soul music. However that music was also influenced by gospel music which was religious. One common idea about souls that is easy to express, is that a person \"is\" a soul, and \"has\" a body. The soul is the \"I\" in \"I exist\" that feels and lives life. What people call the mind could be \"part\" of the soul: one soul started this article, other souls have edited it, and another soul is reading it. This view, however, implies that the human body is a possession, and seems to devalue bodies that do not have souls as defined or understood by the speaker (some people say that animals, heretics, and people of another religion do not have souls). Like most uses of the verb to be, there is an ideology in these simple words. Characteristics. One distinction often made is between soul, which is distinct from other souls, and spirit which may be combined with that of other beings. The idea of the Holy Spirit in Christianity, for example, is a universal and shared spirit many souls are part of, and which is expressed on Earth in that faith by \"the Church\" meaning \"the body of Christ\" meaning \"all bodies that follow Jesus.\" This could be more inclusive than the is/has view of souls and bodies. Reincarnation. Reincarnation is a belief that says that after the body dies, the soul will be born again in another body.",
   "Service economy": "A service is a job or work done for someone else. Often, the person who gives the service will get something in return for the service. The person who gives the service can get money in return. The person who gives the service can get goods in return. The person who gives the service can get another service in return. This is a type of trade. All the service trades in a place form a service economy. The service economy can be in a region like a country or in a town or city.",
   "Synagogue": "A synagogue is a place where Jews meet to worship and pray to God. In Hebrew, a synagogue is called \"beit knesset\", which means, a \"house of gathering\". The word \"synagogue\" comes from \"sunagoge\", which is a Greek word. In a synagogue, Jews do the Jewish services, which are prayers, sometimes with special actions. A synagogue will always have a big room for prayers. There might be some smaller rooms for studying. There will be some offices. There will also usually be a big room for special events. The front of a synagogue faces towards Jerusalem in Israel. In the front is the holiest part of the synagogue, the Ark. This is a closet which has the Torah scrolls inside. The Torah scrolls have the holy writings of Judaism on them. The Ark usually has a curtain in front of it. On top of the Ark is light which is always lit, called the \u201cEternal Lamp\u201d. It is a symbol which means that God is always there. Every synagogue has a raised platform called the \u201cBimah\u201d. The person who reads the Torah scroll stands there when he reads. The Bimah is either in the middle of the hall, or in front of the Ark. In some synagogues men and women sit in different places. Some synagogues even have a short wall so that they can not see each other. This is so that the people will think about the prayers better. Jews may call synagogues by different names. Many Orthodox and Conservative Jews living in English-speaking countries use the name \"synagogue\" or \"shul.\" Jews who speak Spanish or Portuguese call synagogues \"esnoga\". Some Jews call the synagogue a temple.",
   "Textual difficulty": "What textual tests do is give people an idea about the density of their writing. Readability tests can not tell them how easily a reader can understand the information in the text.",
   "Theatre": "Theatre (in British English and American English), or Theater (in American English only), has several meanings. In American English, the word \"theater\" can mean either a place where films are shown (this is called a \"cinema' in British English) or a place where live stage plays are performed. In British English, \"theatre\" means a place where live plays are performed. Theatre or Theater can also mean the business of putting on plays. An actor might say \"I am in the theatre business,\" or a writer might say \"I write for the theatre,\" meaning that they write plays, rather than writing for movies or television shows. Ancient Greece. The first people to create plays were the Ancient Greeks, in about the year 500 A.D. They divided plays into two kinds: tragedy and comedy. This division is still used today. The most known Ancient Greek writers of plays are Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and Aristophanes; their plays are still played today. These ancient Greek plays were performed outdoors in large amphitheatres for large crowds. These plays were very popular. There were contests among the playwrights (people who write plays are called playwrights) and the winner would win a prize of a goat, some money or maybe some wine. Middle Ages. In the Middle Ages, the Christian church began to use theatre as a way of telling the stories from the Bible to people who did not know how to read. They wrote Mystery Plays, where each part of the Bible story would be a play put on by a different group of people. They also wrote Miracle Plays which were plays about the lives of the saints. There were also Morality plays which taught the audiences how to live a good Christian life. Commedia dell' arte comic plays during the 1500s. In the 1500s, groups of actors who would tour around Italy performing comic plays to entertain townspeople. These plays were called Commedia dell'arte, and different stories would be created around the same group of characters. Often the spoken lines would be made up by the actors for each performance. Other kinds of plays called Neoclassical Dramas and Neoclassical Comedies were also popular in Italy and in France at this time. These plays were written to copy the style of the plays from Ancient Greece and Rome. At the end of the sixteenth century (the 1500s), the travelling actors began to perform in fixed theatre buildings. This was the period when William Shakespeare wrote. He lived from 1564 to 1616. At that time, in England, women were not allowed to perform, so male actors would play female characters. His theatre was in London, England. It was called The Globe. It was an outdoor theatre and plays were performed in the daytime for large audiences. His plays were very popular and are many are still performed today. Many scholars and theatre people believe Shakespeare was one of the best playwrights (a writer of plays). He wrote many kinds of plays: tragedies, comedies, romances and also history plays. All of his plays are written in beautiful, poetic language. Shakespeare often wrote plays set in Italy or in exotic, far-away places that would be interesting to London audiences. His plays are still popular today for many reasons. His characters (the people in his plays) are interesting and talk about interesting ideas. The stories he tells in his plays are often exciting, very funny (in the comedies), or very sad (in the tragedies) and make you want to know what happens to his characters. He also talks in his plays about things we still think about today, like love, sadness, hope, pride, hatred, jealousy, and foolishness. Plays from the 1700s. \"This section currently needs your knowledge to help others on this subject. Thank You.\" Plays from the 1800s. \"This section currently needs your knowledge to help others on this subject. Thank You.\" Plays from the 1900s. After World War II, playwrights in Europe and the United States began doing plays in a new style called \"Theatre of the Absurd.\" After seeing the horrors of war, these playwrights felt that all their old values had been destroyed. Playwrights such as Samuel Beckett, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Harold Pinter, and Jean Genet wrote plays that are considered to be \"Theatre of the Absurd.\" The \"Theatre of the Absurd\" plays have some of the same ideas that are found in the philosophy (a way of thinking) called existentialism. Existentialism is very different from many other \"philosophies\". Most religions and philosopies say that human life has a meaning (or a purpose). The philosophy of existentialism is that human life does not have a meaning (or a purpose). When something has no meaning, it is \"absurd\". (absurd means means silly and meaningless.) The plays written in this style make people think about questions like \"what is it like to be a person in the world?\" and \"what does it mean for a person to be free?\" They are often filled with sad emotions, such as worry, fear, and thoughts about death. Plays from the 2000s. There are many other types of plays performed in the theatre today. Theatre Breaks. Theatre breaks are a form of short break, based around viewing a theatrical show. Theatre breaks tend to include a nights hotel accommodation included in the price. Some theatre breaks websites have been trading for over 20years.",
   "Time limit": "A time limit is a time horizon that is imposed on everyone at once. It may be used to try to achieve fairness in some system of ethics. For instance, if poor people and rich people are debating something, a time limit may be imposed so that the rich people cannot keep debating until the poor people have to go to work, and lose. Time limits are very important in accounting so that everyone can report their results (for tax and investment purposes) at the same time. This in turn creates deadlines for the accountant and those reporting. However, the deadline is imposed by an authority, whereas the time limit is imposed by a system. So there can be slack in a deadline, so that results do not have to be reported always very fast. For example, in the United States of America, the end of the calendar year on December 31 is the time limit for taxes, but the deadline for reporting is April 15. Sometimes the government allows more time, as it did for the families of those who were killed in the September 11, 2001 attacks.",
   "Ten Commandments": "According to the Old Testament, the Ten Commandments were rules for life given by God to the Jews at Mt. Sinai. Sometimes these rules are also called Decalogue (from Greek, can be translated as \"ten statements\"). The name decalogue first occurs in the Septuagint. The Jews received the commandments after they had left Egypt during the reign of Pharaoh Ramses. The commandments can be found in the Bible in the book of Exodus chapter 20 and in slightly different form in the book of Deuteronomy chapter 5. They are also implied in the Qur'an. Since there have been many translations, there may be variations in the way the commandments are written. Commandments in the Bible. The Bible does not number the commandments. Different religious groups have numbered them in different ways. The Jews, followed by Christian Protestants, end the first commandment with \"You are to have no other gods but me.\" as above. Catholics and Lutherans end the first commandment at \"I will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws.\" and separate in their last two commandments the desire for a man's wife from the desire for other things he owns. Interpretation. To \"put anyone to death without cause\", called murder, may mean all killing including execution and war, or exclude these. To \"be false to the married relation\", called adultery, is when a married person has sex with a person other than his or her spouse. The Bible does not say this includes unmarried people having sex with each other, although some people think this. Some have interpreted Exodus 22:16 to mean that if two unmarried people have sex, they should make a commitment to one another. To \"give false witness\" called lying, may include all lying, or only include lying in a court, called perjury. To \"desire... your neighbour's house, or his wife, or his servant or his ox\", implies that wives and servants were owned by a man in Moses' time, although this is not so today. Some people say that this means trying to get what the person wants, while others say it means even wanting it. In the New Testament, Jesus talked about who was guilty of breaking these commandments. He said that even if someone was just angry and rude to another person, they might be judged for murder, and if they just looked with desire or lust at a woman, they had committed adultery in their heart. Different numbering. The commandments passage in Exodus has more than ten imperative statements, there are 14 or 15 in all. While the Bible itself gives the count as \"10\", using the Hebrew phrase \"\u02bbaseret had'varim\"\u2014translated as \"the 10 words\", \"statements\" or \"things\", this phrase does not appear in the passages usually presented as being \"the Ten Commandments\". Various religions divide the commandments differently. The table below shows those differences. What others say about them. In general, religions other than those mentioned (Judaism, Christianity,Islam) do not recognise the Ten Commandments as ethical standards. Many of them (Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, etc.) have similar laws or principles though. In the atheist Soviet Union the Moral Code of the Builder of Communism was a set of rules that resembled the Ten Commandments. Sabbath day. Most Christians believe that Sunday is a special day of worship and rest. It is there to remember the Resurrection of Jesus on the first day of the week on the Jewish calendar. They say that there is an analogy between the obligation of the Christian day of worship and the Sabbath-day ordinance. These two rules are not literally identical though. They say that this ordinance is no longer valid, because God has replaced his old creation by a new one (). For this reason, the obligation to keep the Sabbath is not the same for Christians as for Jews. They say there are examples in the New Testament, and in other writings surviving from the first few centuries. Some conservative Christians are \"Sabbatarians\". Most of these follow the Reformed traditions. Sabbatarians think the first day of the week or \"Lord's Day\" is the new Sabbath. This is because the 4th commandment has never been revoked and Sabbath-keeping is in any case a creation ordinance. Still others believe that the Sabbath remains as a day of rest on the Saturday, reserving Sunday as a day of worship. In reference to Acts 20:7, the disciples came together on the first day of the week (Sunday) to break bread and to hear the preaching of the apostle Paul. This is not the first occurrence of Christians assembling on a Sunday; Jesus appeared to the Christians on the \"first day of the week\" while they were in hiding. One can maintain this argument in that Jesus himself maintained the Sabbath, although not within the restrictions that were mandated by Jewish traditions; the Pharisees often tried Jesus by asking him if certain tasks were acceptable according to the Law (see: Luke 14:5). This would seem to indicate that while the Sabbath was still of importance to the Jews, Sunday was a separate day for worship and teaching from Scriptures. The Seventh-day Adventists and other churches disagree with some of these views. They argue that the custom of meeting for worship on Sunday originated in paganism, specifically Sol Invictus and Mithraism (in which sun-god worship took place on Sunday). This is therefore an explicit rejection of the commandment to keep the \"seventh\" day holy. Instead, they keep Saturday as the Sabbath as a memorial to God's work of creation (,) believing that none of the Ten Commandments can ever be destroyed (,). Seventh-day Sabbatarians claim that the seventh day Sabbath was kept by the majority of Christian groups until the 2nd and 3rd century, by most until the 4th and 5th century, and a few thereafter, but because of opposition to Judaism after the Jewish-Roman wars, the original custom was gradually replaced by Sunday as the day of worship. The history of these changes is certainly not altogether lost regardless of any belief in a suppression of the facts by a conspiracy of the pagans of the Roman Empire and the clergy of the Catholic Church. See Great Apostasy. Jews had come to be hated in the Roman Empire after the Jewish-Roman wars. This led to the criminalization of the Jewish Sabbath. Hatred of Jews is apparent in the Council of Laodicea (4th Century AD) where Canon 37\u201338 states: \"It is not lawful to receive portions sent from the feasts of Jews or heretics, nor to feast together with them.\" and \"It is not lawful to receive unleavened bread from the Jews, nor to be partakers of their impiety.\" In keeping with this rejection of the Jews, this Roman council also criminalized the Jewish Sabbath as can be seen in Canon 29 of the Council Laodicea: \"Christians must not Judaize by resting on the Sabbath, but must work on that day, rather honoring the Lord's Day; and, if they can, resting then as Christians. But if any shall be found to be judaizers, let them be anathema (excommunicated) from Christ.\" Killing or murder. Various translations exist of the sixth commandment; the Hebrew words \u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05e8\u05e6\u05d7 are translated either as \"thou shalt not kill\" or \"thou shalt not murder\". Older Protestant translations of the Bible, those based on the Vulgate and Roman Catholic translations usually translate it \"Thou shalt not kill\". Jewish and newer Protestant versions tend to use \"You shall not murder\". There is controversy as to which translation is more faithful, and both forms are quoted in support of ethical standpoints. The Vulgate (Latin) translation has \"Non occides\", i.e. \"Thou shalt not kill\". English translations using \"kill\" include the King James (Authorised) (1611) [although note Matthew \"do no murder\", following the Vulgate \"non homicidium facies\"], the American Standard (1901) and Revised Standard (American Protestant, 1952) Versions. Almost all Roman Catholic translations, including the Douay-Rheims Bible (1609/1752), the New American Bible (1970), the New Jerusalem Bible (1985) and the Christian Community Bible (1986), have \"kill\". Martin Luther (German, 1534) also uses \"t\u00f6ten\" (kill). Protestant translations using \"murder\" include the New International Version (American, 1978), New American Standard Bible (American, 1971), New English Bible (British Protestant, 1970), and the New King James (American, 1982), New Revised Standard (American, 1989) and English Standard (American Protestant, 2001) Versions. Jewish translations almost all use \"murder\", including the Jewish Publication Society of America Version (1917), the Judaica Press tanach (1963) and the Living Torah (1981). A Jewish exception is the Artscroll or \"Stone Edition\" tanach (1996). The many examples in the Old Testament of killing sanctioned by God, are quoted in defense of the view that \"murder\" is more accurate. Furthermore, the Hebrew word for \"kill\" is \"\u05d4\u05e8\u05d2\" - \"harog\", while the Hebrew word for \"murder\" is \"\u05e8\u05e6\u05d7\" - \"retzach\", which is found in the Ten Commandments \"\u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05e8\u05e6\u05d7\" - \"lo tirtzach\". Different interpretations of stealing. Many academic theologians (such as German Old Testament scholar A. Alt: \"Das Verbot des Diebstahls im Dekalog\" (1953)) suggest that commandment \"you shall not steal\" was originally intended against stealing people \u2014 against abductions and slavery. This would be the same as the Jewish interpretation of the statement as \"you shall not kidnap\" (e.g. as stated by Rashi). The problem with images of God. Christianity says that a very important element of the commandment not to make \"any image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above\" is \"and bow down and worship it\". Another understanding on this comes from Roman Catholicism: they hold that one may build and use \"likenesses\", as long as the object is not worshipped. As a result, many Roman Catholic Churches and services feature images, some feature statues, and in some Orthodox services, icons are venerated. For most Roman Catholics, this practice is understood as fulfilling the observance of this commandment, as they understand these images are not being worshipped. Eastern Orthodoxy teaches that the incarnation of invisible God as a visible human, Jesus, makes it permissible and necessary to venerate icons. For Jews and Muslims veneration violates this commandment. Jews and Muslims read this commandment as prohibiting the use of idols and images in any way. Some Protestants will picture Jesus in his human form, while refusing to make any image of God or Jesus in Heaven. Very few Christians oppose the making of any images at all. Some groups have been critical of the use others make of images in worship. (See iconoclasm.) In particular, the Orthodox have criticized the Roman Catholic use of decorative statues, Roman Catholics have criticized the Orthodox veneration of icons, and some Protestant groups have criticized the use of stained-glass windows by many other denominations. Jehovah's Witnesses criticize the use of all of the above, as well as the use of the cross. Amish people forbid any sort of graven image, such as photos. The Ritual Decalogue. The term \"Ten Commandments\" without a modifier generally applies to the lists mentioned in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5. However, there is a continuous story being told starting in Exodus 31:18 (where the stones are created), Exodus 32:19 (where the tablets are broken) and Exodus 34. This story lists a very different set of commandments. This version is sometimes called \"Ritual Decalogue\". Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and the people after him who followed the documentary hypothesis, note that Exodus 34:28 seems to refer to these Ten Commandments rather than the traditional ones. These people thought that the commandments in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 show a later set of Ten Commandments, and that the ten listed in Exodus 34 were the original Ten Commandments, now known as the \"Ritual Decalogue\" (as opposed to the better-known \"Ethical Decalogue\"). The differences between the two Decalogues highlight the development of sacred texts over a long time and from differing narrative traditions by incorporating two differing sets of Ten Commandments. Influence. The commandments have influenced Jewish ethics and law and, through Judaism and Christianity, Western ethics and law since the Roman Empire.",
   "Tree": "A tree is a tall plant with a trunk and branches made of wood. It can live for many years. The four main parts of a tree are the roots, the trunk, the branches, and the leaves. The roots of a tree are under the ground. A single tree has many roots. The roots carry food and water from the ground through the trunk and branches to the leaves of the tree. The trunk is the main body of the tree. The trunk is covered with bark which protects it from damage. Branches grow from the trunk. They spread out so that the leaves can receive sunlight. The leaves of a tree are usually green, but they can come in many colors, shapes and sizes. The leaves take in sunlight and use water and food from the roots to make the tree grow, and to reproduce.",
   "Temple": "A temple is a building where people go to practice their religion. In a temple people perform religious activities like prayers and worship of God. Thus, a temple is a general term for a house of worship. Christians usually call their religious buildings churches.",
   "Unprofitable": "When something is unprofitable, it means that there is no profit being made. If a company makes a product that is not popular and not many people buy it, we can say that the product is unprofitable. A product can also be unprofitable if many people want to buy it, but only at a lower price than it can be made for.",
   "U.S. customary units": "U.S customary units are those used to measure things in the United States. Length or distance units include the inch, foot, yard and mile. Land units include square miles (2589998.47032 square meter) and acres (4046.8726 square meter). Common volume units are the teaspoon, tablespoon (3 teaspoons), fluid ounce (two tablespoons), cup (8 ounces), pint (2 cups, or 16 fluid ounces), quart (2 pints, or 32 fluid ounces), US gallon (16 cups, 128 fluid ounces, or 3.8 liters). A barrel is the unit to measure oil. Units of weight include the pound (453.6 grams), which contains 16 ounces. This should not be confused with the British pound which is a type of money. The different uses of the word \"pound\" can cause confusion. Some people have been trying to get rid of these units in the United States and replace them with the metric system since the 1820s. During and after World War II there was much infrastructure built using the old measures by both British and Americans. When this is gone it will be easier to get rid of these units.",
   "University": "A university is a place like a school. Students learn at a university after high school (secondary school) in the United States. In the United Kingdom students learn at a university after secondary school or after college. Teachers at a university educate and do research in difficult subjects. Advanced students help to research - mostly for their diploma at the end. History. The universities were born in Europe during the Middle Ages. The first institution of this type was the University of Bologna that later became a model for similar centers of education. This term can often be used in other cultures to mean centers of higher education and higher thought, although their creation was often well before the Middle Ages. That earliest division caused the present divisions between literary and scientific fields. Organization. A university can include several campuses, or different places where classes are taught. In each campus there are several faculties and university schools (mainly for teaching), and also laboratories, departments and institutes of research. Many campuses also have housing for students in buildings called dormitories and structures like libraries, study rooms, and gymnasiums for students that live there. Each school offers many courses that students take to earn a degree. The person with the highest right to control and to command in a university is the rector, who governs the university with the help of the party of vice-rectors and of other organs: social council, governing body, etc.",
   "Volap\u00fck": "Volap\u00fck is a constructed language created in 1880 by Johann Martin Schleyer. Schleyer was a Catholic priest from Germany. He felt that God had told him in a dream to make an international language. Volap\u00fck conventions took place in 1884, 1887, and 1889. The aim was to help people from different cultures speak to each other. Volap\u00fck became less popular after 1887 when Esperanto was published. Part of the reason was because Esperanto was easier to learn. There are only 25-30 Volap\u00fck speakers in the world today. The vocabulary of Volap\u00fck was mostly English, with some German and French. \"Vol\" and \"p\u00fck\" come from the English words \"world\" and \"speech\". The grammar is based on Indo-European languages and is more difficult than Esperanto. O Fat obas, kel binol in s\u00fcls, paisaludom\u00f6z nem ola!

   "Venus": "\"This article is about the planet Venus. For other uses see here\" Venus is the second planet from the Sun in our Solar System. Venus is a \"terrestrial planet\" along with Mercury, Earth and Mars because it has a solid surface. Venus has been known by astronmers for thousands of years. The ancient romans named it in honour of their godess Venus. It is the brightest object in the night sky except for the Moon. It is sometimes called the \"morning star\" or the \"evening star\" as it is most bright just before morning and night. Venus is sometimes called the sister planet of Earth as they are quite similar in size and gravity. Apart from that the two planets are very different. Venus' atmosphere or air is made of thick sulphuric acid, and carbon dioxide. Sulphuric acid is a chemical that is very poisonous to humans. The thick atmosphere has made it hard for people to see the surface of the planet, and until the twenty-first century many people thought things might live on Venus. The pressure on Venus' surface is 92 times that of Earth. Venus has no moons. Physical Properties. Venus is a terrestrial planet so, like the Earth, it's surface is made of rock. Venus is much hotter than Earth. All the carbon dioxide in the atmposhere acts like a blanket around the planet, trapping heat from the Sun and causing a runaway greenhouse effect. This makes Venus the hottest planet in the Solar System with an estimated average temperature of 480 degrees. This is hot enough to melt lead. Geography. Venus' surface is about 80% smooth, rocky plains. Two higher areas called continents make up the north and south of the planet. The north is called \"Ishtar Terra\" and the south is called \"Aphrodite Terra\". They are named after the Babylonian and Greek godesses of love. Atmosphere. Venus' atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas with clouds of sulphuric acid. Because the atmosphere is so thick or dense the pressure is very high. The pressure is 92 times the pressure on Earth, enough to crush many things. The average temperature is 480 degrees. It is impossible to look at the planet's surface from space as the thick cloud layer reflects 60% of the light that hits it. The only way scientists have been able to look is by using infrared and ultraviolet cameras.",
   "Vatican City": "The Vatican City is the smallest country in the world (0.44 km\u00b2) and it is an enclave of Italy because it is surrounded by the city of Rome. It was created as country on February 11 1929, with the \"Patti Lateranensi\" (Lateran Agreement or Treaty), was signed by Benito Mussolini and Pope Pius XI. It is very small, but very important because it is the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church. The Head of State is the Pope, now Benedict XVI, former cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, elected on April 19 2005, after Pope John Paul II's 26 years of Papacy. It is important also by the side of culture and art: its masterpieces are known by everybody in the world: St. Peter's Square, St. Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, the Vatican Museums and the Apostolic Palace, where the Pope lives. There are also hundreds of other sculptures and pictures. History. The Pope used to rule the Papal States. This used to cover all of Central Italy. Popes had always tried to stop Italy becoming one country because they might lose their control of the Papal States. In 1861 Italy was unified under the King of Savoy, but Rome and Latium remained unconquered. Only on September 20 1870 the Italian troops invaded and beat the Papal troops. Rome became capital of the new kingdom. The Pope said he was a prisoner of the Italian state and excommunicated all the people who helped the people who invaded his state. This stopped Catholics from taking part in public life. In 1929 Benito Mussolini decided to sign an agreement with the Holy See, called the Lateran Treaty, which created the Vatican State. Another treaty gave the Vatican money each year to compensate for the lost territories.",
   "World Wide Web": "The World Wide Web (\"WWW\" or \"The Web\") is the part of the Internet that contains websites and webpages. It was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland. Sir Tim Berners-Lee created a new language called HTML. Websites are composed of pages linked by hypertext links. They are all written in HTML. The World Wide Web is not used to describe HTML webpages that are not part of the Internet. In order to see the World Wide Web one needs a computer and a computer program called a web browser. Many websites nowadays offer free websites allowing one to make websites that can be displayed on the WWW like any other domain (www.domain-name.com) site. These sites make money from advertisements instead of fees. One thing about \"WWW\" is that it takes longer to say it out \"double-you, double-you, double-you\" than just simply saying \"World Wide Web\". It acts as a abbreviation only when you write it out. Some people just say \"triple double-you\".",
   "Wiki": "A wiki is a type of website that lets anyone create and edit its pages. The word is Internet slang. The word \"Wiki\" is short for WikiWikiWeb. \"Wikiwiki\" is a word from Hawaiian, meaning \"fast\" or \"speed\". Examples of wiki include Wikipedia, Anarchopedia, Conservapedia etc. Every wiki can be changed, or edited by everyone, although some important pages cannot be changed by anyone. Wikis are central places where we all can share information with each other, people can add new information, and then people read them. Wikis allow information from all around the world to be collection. In a wiki, people can write pages together. If one person writes something wrong, then the next person can correct it. The next person can also add something new to the page. Because of this, the page gets better whenever someone changes it. If someone writes information that is very obviously wrong, and the person actually wanted to vandalise, it would be changed by administrators, and the person will not be able to change the wiki anymore. People can discuss there as well. Discussion can make people understand things better, or gives people a chance to tell their views. In Wikipedia the talk pages are for that, but in some wikis, the article and the discussion are in the same page. Wikis can be used for different things and all wikis don't follow the same rules for using them. For example, the purpose of Wikipedia is to write articles, which form an encyclopedia. That's why in Wikipedia, people don't want to hear general discussion that doesn't help in writing articles. Ward Cunningham started the first wiki in March 1995. Many people liked the place and wrote there, after which they started similar websites.",
   "Website": "A website is a set of webpages that are joined together. People look at websites with a computer of some kind, sometimes including the computer inside mobile telephones (see WAP) and televisions. They are hosted on computers called web servers. Homepage. There is almost always a single homepage which introduces the rest of the website - containing links to other pages that may be considered part of that \"site\" or part of other \"sites\" (in net jargon which confuses a physical site in the real world with a web URL - which is not physical). Uses. Websites can be used to advertise or sell things. They can also be used to talk to other people. A blog is a web where the location of the material is less relevant than who writes it, and which is more focused on dialogue. Very often the people who use blogs dislike the word \"site\" since it implies a controlled place. A wiki. A wiki is a website where people who visit it can edit it in most cases. Access. Users can access any web (site, blog, or wiki) by using a URL. The homepage and the rest of the site usually has the same root URL - for instance, pages at the Simple English Wikipedia always start \"http://simple.wikipedia.org/...\" but then are different after that. Appearence. Web sites are usually shown in HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) but are not always written or maintained that way - some use WAP and others use XML.",
   "Word": "A word is something spoken by the mouth, that can be pronounced. It is also a collection of letters used together to try to communicate a meaning, and these can also usually be pronounced. Some words can be only one letter, for example \"a\" and \"I\" in English. Besides English, every other language also has its own words. For example, \"hello\" is a word.",
   "Web browser": "A web browser is a computer program that lets people find and read web pages on the Internet. Browsers read documents that are written in HTML (HyperText Markup Language) to display images and text with clickable links. They use rules such as HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) to transfer data with the World Wide Web.",
   "World War II": "World War II was a war fought between the Allies and the Axis Powers. It was called a \"World War\" because countries from every continent became involved, and fighting took place all over the world. Of all the wars ever fought, World War II involved the most countries, cost the most money, and killed the most people. About 72 million died, making it the worst human disaster of all time. It ran from 1939 until 1945. The two sides. The Axis Powers at the start of the war were Germany, Italy and Japan. These countries made an agreement called the Berlin-Rome-Tokyo Axis in the year of 1937, in which they agreed to help each other in military conflicts. This agreement, also called the Anti-Comintern Pact, was primarily aimed against the Soviet Union. The Allied Powers, or Allies, were the United Kingdom and France at the outbreak of war in September 1939. The Soviet Union joined the Allies in June 1941 after being invaded by Germany, and the United States joined the war on the side of the Allies on 11th December 1941, four days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, when Hitler declared war on the US. Canada, India, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand were also part of the Allied coalition as British Dominions. Why the war started. In Europe, World War I occurred during the years of 1914 through 1918. Germany faced the burden of defeat. In the aftermath, Germany had to surrender a select area of land and money as compensation for the damage done. Areas along the Rhine River were occupied by France for a time. Germany was informed that its army had to have less than 100,000 men. Germany was not allowed to have an air force or big ships in its navy. Adolf Hitler, leader of the Nazi Party, took control of Germany in 1933. He prosecuted and persecuted others for whom he did not like. Hitler also expanded the size of the German air force, army, and navy. He wanted to take land from other countries, as well as hated many groups of people including Russians, Jews, and people with dark skin. In 1938, Germany threatened Czechoslovakia, a small country, but the Allies decided to stay neutral in this event. In fact the Britain and France made a pact with Germany, at Munich in September 1938, to take part of Czechoslovakia called the Sudetenland. Hitler promised that he would stop attacking, but six months later, he broke his promise and took over all of Czechoslovakia including the capital, Prague. The Allies, not including the United States, thought Poland would be the next country Hitler attacked. They promised to help Poland if it was attacked. In Asia, Japan attacked China in 1937. To stop the United States defending its islands and other countries in the Pacific Ocean, Japan attacked the naval base on Hawaii named Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Beginning of the War (September 1939 - August 1940). World War II began on September 1, 1939, in respone to the German invasion of Poland, with the aid of Russia. In response, Britain and France declared war on Germany. By 1941, Germany had conquered Poland, France, Norway, Holland, Belgium and Denmark, controlling most of Europe. Japan then started to begin to expand its country to include parts of China and some islands near the Pacific. September 1940 - May 1944. By September 1940, Hitler controlled large sections of Europe. He hoped that the British would ask for peace, but they did not. German aeroplanes bombed the city of London to weaken the British. The bombings lasted about two years. Winston Churchill played a major role in keeping citizens under control but by the time The Blitz ended many civilians lost their lives. In June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union. The Soviets joined the Allied Powers. The majority of German forces would spend the war fighting the Soviets. Adolf Hitler planned to capture the Soviet Union and place a blockade (not letting anything in or out) on Britain, creating a \"Fortress Europe\" that would be very difficult to invade. The invasion started on June 22, 1941. The German army captured large amounts of Soviet land and encircled Leningrad. By December the Germans advanced as far as Moscow, but were stopped by Russian army. On December 7, 1941, Japanese fighters attacked an American port in Hawaii named Pearl Harbor. On December 11, the Axis Powers declared war on the United States. In November 1942, the battle fought there, named El Alamein, resulted in an Allied victory and Italy and the Allies became close. The German war machine needed more oil, as Germany only had the relatively small oilfields of Romania under its control. Therefore in 1942, when the Germans began advancing again in Russia, their target was the oilfields of the Caucasus. To secure this territory, the Germans needed to take the city of Stalingrad, but they were defeated in the Battle of Stalingrad, which was the turning point of the war. At the same time the Siege of Leningrad was relieved. On July 10, 1943, Allied forces landed on the Italian island of Sicily, in an operation named \"Husky\". They were successful in taking the island, and Italy fell shortly after. In the Pacific Ocean, the Japanese empire was getting bigger and bigger. The United States, now at war with the Axis, began to send out ships to attack the Japanese navy. The result of a large deployment, or sending out, of ships was the famous Battle of Midway on June 4, 1942, which was an American victory. Hoping that Japan was weakened by this defeat, the Americans landed in Guadalcanal on August 7, 1942. The result was another American victory, and a capture of a very important place. The war was very bad, both economically and socially. The European Front. As the war went on, the Allies saw that they would need to land in Europe to defeat Germany. They chose a small piece of coastline in France called Normandy for the invasion. On June 6, 1944, the Allies invaded Normandy and began the Battle of Normandy, code named Operation Overlord or D-Day. It was an Allied victory. As the Allies fought to get to Berlin, the capital of Germany, the Germans attacked fiercely to defend their land. The resulting battle was named the Battle of the Bulge, and was an Allied victory. It was the last time in the war that the Germans were able to send a major attack against the Allies. In the spring of 1945, the Soviet Red Army closed in on Berlin and captured it, defeating Germany. The Soviet general, Georgy Zhukov reached Berlin before the Americans, and won an unspoken \"contest\" between Generals to see who could get to Berlin first. The day that Germany officially surrendered (gave up), May 8, 1945, was a day marked with large celebrations. Today, the day is called V-E Day, or \"Victory in Europe Day.\" The Pacific Front. After the battles of Midway and Guadalcanal, the Japanese were being pushed slowly out of the Pacific. Many battles were fought in the Pacific. The United States went on an \"Island Hopping\" campaign to capture small islands that were under Japanese control. Of these small islands came some very large battles, such as Iwo Jima and Okinawa in 1945. President Harry Truman of the Americans gave the order to drop an atomic bomb on Japan. On August 6, 1945, bombers dropped an atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima. Three days later, on August 9, bombers dropped another atomic bomb on the city of Nagasaki. Only 6 days later, on August 15, Japan surrendered to the Allies. President Truman marked the end of the war on September 2, calling it V-J Day, or \"Victory over Japan Day.\" Today it is sometimes called V-P Day for \"Victory in the Pacific.\" Products of the War. The war introduced new methods for fighting, approaches, and knowledge gained during the war. A major new technology was radar (finding airplanes by using radio waves). The war also made weapons with far more killing power. The atomic bomb was first used by the United States during this war. President Truman ordered two atomic bombs to be dropped from airplanes on the two Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. No atomic weapons have been used in war since then.",

   "Microsoft Windows": "Microsoft Windows is an operating system made by Microsoft. It is currently the most widespread operating system in use, being used by 90% of computer users. Some believe that it only was more popular than Mac OS because it was programmed to be more flexible with non-Microsoft hardware, and is more well-known than Linux. It is installed on most new computers. Microsoft Windows was first made in 1985. The most recent version is Windows Vista which was released in 2007. Bill Gates helped with making Windows. He is now the vice chief executive officer of Microsoft. Windows lets people run programs and sort their files. It has many programs that come with it, these can read and write simple documents and pictures. There are also applications which let people use the internet, look at web pages and read e-mail. There is also an application for listening to music and watching videos; it is called Windows Media Player.",
   "Window": "A window is an opening in a wall of a building, in a car etc., to let air and light in. It is usually filled with a sheet of glass. There can be many different shapes, including rectangular, square, circular, or irregular shapes. In a graphical operating system, a window is a rectangle within a screen that displays some data or pictures to a user. Windows can contain many things, for example a web browser.",
   "Wine": "Wine is an alcoholic drink. Society usually uses the word for the drink made from the juice of grapes, although people sometimes call alcoholic drinks made from the juice of other fruits (such as plums or blackberries) \"wine\". This article only deals with wine made from grapes. Wine is made by the fermentation of the sugar in grapes. There are two main types of wine, red wine and white wine. Ros\u00e9 wine is made by leaving red grapes in skin contact for very short. The colour comes only from the skin, so if you have short skin contact, the wine will not turn red but only \"pink\" (rose wine). Wine sometimes has bubbles in it; this wine is called sparkling wine. The most popular sparkling wine is champagne. People have been making wine for about 5000 years. France, Italy, USA, Germany, Spain, Argentina, the United Kingdom, China, Russia, and Romania.

   "Want": "A want is a wish or a desire for something. If a person would like to have something, but can choose not to have it, that thing is wanted or can be called a want. To want is not the same as to need, which is when someone \"must\" have something. People often talk about needing a thing, when they really just want it. Wants can be for the same things as needs. For example, a person can \"need\" to eat food and can \"want\" to eat cake. If there is no cake then he or she may have to eat something else, perhaps bread. The need is no longer so important (the person is no longer hungry) although the want may still be there. If there is cake, then the person's needs and wants can both be met. In economics, a want is about goods or services. Choice is how to satisfy (or meet) a want, when there are different ways to do this. Want can also be the idea of what it means to be poor, hungry or with no money. Charles Dickens wrote a famous book called \"A Christmas Carol\" in which there are two children, named Want and Ignorance.",
   "War": "\"For the 1970s funk band, see War (band).\" War is any fighting involving the organized use of weapons and harmful force between countries or other large-scale groups. See Articles 2(3), 2(4) and 2(7) of the United Nations Charter. Many years ago, a German soldier named Karl von Clausewitz wrote in his classic book, On War: \"Der Krieg ist eine blo\u00dfe Fortsetzung der Politik mit anderen Mitteln\" (\"War is simply a continuation of politics with other methods\") and \"War is a way of using force to get our enemies to do what we want them to do.\" Wars have been fought to control natural resources, for religious or cultural reasons, over political balances of power, legitimacy (legality) of particular laws, to settle economic and territorial arguments, and many other issues. The reasons of any war are very complex; while a war can start for just about any reason, there is usually more than one issue involved. Kinds of war. Sometimes people see a difference between fighting between countries or people and the formal declaration of a state of war. Those who see this difference usually only use the word \"war\" for the fighting where the countries' governments have officially declared war on each other. Smaller armed conflicts are often called riots, rebellions, coups, etc. When one country sends armed forces to another country, supposedly to rebuild order or prevent killings of innocents or other crimes against humanity, or to protect another government friendly to it against an uprising, that country sometimes refers to it as a police action. This usage is not always recognized as valid, however, particularly by those who do not accept the usages of the term. A war where the forces in conflict live in within the same country is known as a civil war. War is contrasted with peace, which some people define as the absence of war. Another approach to classifying warfare divides it into four \"generations\" of war. First generation warfare. First generation warfare reflects tactics of the era of the smoothbore musket, the tactics of line and column. Operational art in the first generation did not exist as a idea although it was practiced by individual commanders, most famously by Napoleon. Second generation warfare. Second generation warfare was developed in response to the rifled musket, breechloaders, barbed wire, the machinegun, and indirect fire. Tactics were based on fire and movement but they remained linear, with the defense still trying to prevent all penetrations and the attacks along a sideways line advanced by rushes in small groups. Second generation tactics remained the basis of U.S. policy until the 1980s, and they are still practiced by most American units in the field. Third generation warfare. Third generation warfare was first developed by the Germans in World War I, to make up for their inability to match their enemies' industrial production. Its tactics were the first truly nonlinear tactics; attacks rely on penetration to get around and collapse the enemy's combat forces (rather than seeking to get close to the enemy and destroy them), and defense was in depth and often provoked (invited or encouraged) penetration to set the enemy up for a counterattack. Fourth generation warfare. Fourth generation warfare is what most people call a guerrilla war. Fourth generation warfare is far different from the other generations as the objective is not winning a military victory, but rather to destroy the spirit or political means of the enemy from attacking you. Usually it is when a country is brought into another one or when an outside force is trying to destroy the current government. For example, the later part of the Second Iraq war or the U.S. occupation period can be considered fourth generation warfare. Laws of war. A number of treaties and other agreements regulate warfare, collectively referred to as the \"Laws of war\". The most pervasive and famous of those are the Geneva conventions, the earliest of which began to take effect in the mid-1800s. Treaty signing has since been a part of international diplomacy, and too many treaties to mention in this article have been signed. A couple of examples are: Resolutions of the Geneva International Conference, Geneva, 26-29 October 1863 and Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, 75 U.N.T.S. 135, entered into force Oct. 21, 1950. Statistical analysis. The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by Lewis Fry Richardson following World War I. More recent databases of wars have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project [1] and Peter Brecke [2]. See also.

   "Year": "One year is about 365 days long (except in a Leap year). It is the time it takes the Earth to go completely around (Orbit) the sun once. A year is actually 365\u00bc days long, but a calendar has 365 days, except in a leap year. The year starts on January 1 in the Gregorian calendar, but a fiscal year or a school year can start on a different day of the year. There are several ways used to measure the length of a year. Solar and lunar years are used by different societies in daily life. The other measurements are used by astronomers.",
   "Chinese language": "The Chinese language is the language used by Chinese in China and elsewhere. It forms one of the groups of a language family called the Sino-Tibetan family of languages. Chinese can refer to the written or the spoken languages. Chinese is special because although there are many spoken languages, they use only one way of writing the language. Therefore, it is possible to communicate by writing the same way. Many people in China think that although these different languages sound different, they are still one language. They call these different languages \"dialects\" to tell them apart from one another. they refer to the Mandarin language. There are also other Chinese languages, like the Wu and Cantonese, with many speakers. Chinese are used by the Han people in China and other races who have come to recognize themselves as Chinese. Chinese is almost always written in Chinese characters. They are symbols that have meaning, called logograms. Chinese characters have existed for over 5000 years. Nowadays the Mandarin language uses Hanyu pinyin to represent the sounds in Roman letters. All the Chinese languages (or dialects) uses tones. This means that they use pitch sound to set one syllable apart from another. In this way, it is very different from English and most Western languages. Traditional and Simplified characters. In 1956, the government of the People's Republic of China made public a set of simplified Chinese characters to make learning, reading and writing the Chinese language easier. In Mainland China and Singapore, people use these simpler characters. In Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other places where they speak Chinese, people still use the more traditional characters. The Korean language also uses Chinese characters to represent certain words. These are known in Korean as Hanja. A Chinese person with a good education today knows 6,000-7,000 characters. About 3,000 Chinese characters are needed to read a Mainland newspaper. Examples. Here are some samples of some words and sentences in Mandarin Chinese. Simplified Characters are on the left, and Traditional characters are on the right. The pronunciation is given in the pinyin system, which may not always be as simple as it looks for those who have not studied it. The Traditional Characters are now used in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Chinese from Mainland China uses the Simplified Characters, but may recognize Traditional Characters. Before 1956, every Chinese uses the Traditional characters. But during then, 80% of the Chinese people cannot read and write. Many people feel that Traditional Characters are just too hard to remember and write. Because of the use of Simplified Characters, currently in China, more than 90% of the people have learned to read and write Chinese.

   "Zero": "Zero is a special number. If there are zero things, there are not any things. There are none. Example. John has zero hats. John does not have a hat. Symbol. The symbol for the number zero is \"0\". Arithmetic with Zero. Let \"n\" be any number except zero. Then, 0 \u00f7 \"n\" = 0. (0/\"n\" = 0) History of zero. The idea of zero was first thought about in Babylon, India and in Central America at different times. Some places and countries did not know about a zero, which may have made it harder for those people to do mathematics. Over hundreds of years the idea of zero was passed from country to country. From India and Babylon to other places, like Greece, Persia and the Arab parts of the world. The Europeans learned about zero from the Arabs. The place of zero as a number. Zero is not used as a place number (ordinal number). This means that it is not used like 1, 2, or 3 to indicate the order, or place, of something, like 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. 0 \u00f7 0 = \"not a number.\" In time, zero means \"now\". For example, a person is counting down the time to the start of something, such as a foot race or when a rocket takes off. The count is: \"three, two, one, zero (or \"go\")\". Zero is the exact time of the start of the race or when the rocket takes off into the sky. merged bit. 0 (zero) is both a number and a numerical digit used to represent that number in numerals. As a number, zero means \"nothing\" \u2014 an absence of other values. It plays a central role in mathematics as the additive identity of the integers, real numbers, and many other algebraic structures. As a digit, zero is used as a placeholder in place value systems. Historically, it was the last digit to come into use. In the English language, zero may also be called null or nil when a number, o/oh when a numeral, and nought/naught in either context. 0 as a number. 0 is the integer that precedes the positive 1, and follows \u22121. In most (if not all) numerical systems, 0 was identified before the idea of 'negative integers' was accepted. It means \"courageous one\" in hieroglyphics. Zero is a number which quantifies a count or an amount of null size; that is, if the number of your brothers is zero, that means the same thing as having no brothers, and if something has a weight of zero, it has no weight. If the difference between the number of pieces in two piles is zero, it means the two piles have an equal number of pieces. Before counting starts, the result can be assumed to be zero; that is the number of items counted before you count the first item and counting the first item brings the result to one. And if there are no items to be counted, zero remains the final result. While mathematicians all accept zero as a number, some non-mathematicians would say that zero is not a number, arguing that one cannot have zero of something. Others hold that if one has a bank balance of zero, one has a specific quantity of money in that account, namely none. It is that latter view which is accepted by mathematicians and most others. Almost all historians omit the year zero from the proleptic Gregorian and Julian calendars, but astronomers include it in these same calendars. However, the phrase Year Zero may be used to describe any event considered so significant that it virtually starts a new time reckoning. 0 as a numeral. The modern numeral 0 is normally written as a circle or (rounded) rectangle. In old-style fonts with text figures, 0 is usually the same height as a lowercase x. On the seven-segment displays of calculators, watches, etc., 0 is usually written with six line segments, though on some historical calculator models it was written with four line segments. This variant glyph has not caught on. It is important to distinguish the \"number\" zero (as in the \"zero brothers\" example above) from the \"numeral\" or \"digit\" zero, used in numeral systems using positional notation. Successive positions of digits have higher values, so the digit zero is used to skip a position and give appropriate value to the preceding and following digits. A zero digit is not always necessary in a positional number system: bijective numeration provides a possible counterexample. Distinguishing zero from O. The oval-shaped zero and circular letter O together came into use on modern character displays. The zero with a dot in the centre seems to have originated as an option on IBM 3270 controllers (this has the problem that it looks like the Greek letter Theta). The slashed zero, looking identical to the letter O other than the slash, is used in old-style ASCII graphic sets descended from the default typewheel on the venerable ASR-33 Teletype. This format causes problems because of its similarity to the symbol formula_2, representing the empty set, as well as for certain Scandinavian languages which use \u00d8 as a letter. The convention which has the letter O with a slash and the zero without was used at IBM and a few other early mainframe makers; this is even more problematic for Scandinavians because it means two of their letters collide. Some Burroughs/Unisys equipment displays a zero with a \"reversed\" slash. And yet another convention common on early line printers left zero unornamented but added a tail or hook to the letter-O so that it resembled an inverted Q or cursive capital letter-O. The typeface used on some European number plates for cars distinguish the two symbols by making the zero rather egg-shaped and the O more circular, but most of all by slitting open the zero on the upper right side, so the circle is not closed any more (as in). The typeface chosen is called \"f\u00e4lschungserschwerende Schrift\" (abbr.: \"FE Schrift\"), meaning \"script which is harder to falsify\". Note that those used in the United Kingdom do not differentiate between the two as there can never be any ambiguity if the design is correctly spaced. In paper writing one may not distinguish the 0 and O at all, or may add a slash across it in order to show the difference, although this sometimes causes ambiguity in regard to the symbol for the null set.",
   "Zoology": "Zoology is a science. Zoology means \"the study of wildlife\". It is about animals. It is part of biology. Zoologists are scientists that study animals. They usually work on animals in the wild.",
   "Zebra": "A zebra is a mammal of the \"Equidae\" family. The name \"zebra\" is used for several different species of the genus \"Equus\". Zebras live in Africa. Zebras are related to horses and donkeys. Appearance. All zebras have a very short fur. Their fur has black and white stripes. The main part of the body has mostly vertical stripes, and the legs have horizontal stripes. They also have a dark line down their back. Each of the different zebra species has a bit different stripes. Life. Zebras live in families with one male and lots of females. They can have babies (foals) when they are about five years old and can have one foal every year. Zebras mainly eat grass, but they also eat fruit, leaves and some vegetables. They always live near water. Zebras live naturally in Africa, south of the Sahara desert. But most zoos have them as well.",
   "Copyright": "A copyright is a law that gives the owner of a written document, musical composition, book, picture, or other creative work, the right to decide what other people can do with it. Copyright laws make it easier for authors to make money by selling their works. Because of copyright, a work can only be copied if the owner of the copyright gives permission. People who copy a work that is protected under copyright without permission can be punished by the law, usually with a fine. In other, more serious cases, a person who copies a work that is protected under copyright could be arrested or go to prison. Who owns copyright? In most countries, authors automatically own the copyright to any work they make or create, as long as they do not give the copyright to someone else. In most countries, there is no need to register the copyright, and some countries do not even have procedures to register copyrights. But, in countries where registration is available, without registration, it may be difficult to prove that the copyright of a work belongs to a certain author. So it is often a good idea to register anyway, especially for works that are sold for money. If an author gets paid to make a work for someone else, the person who pays for making the work (for example, the author's employer) will often get to own the copyright instead of the author him- or herself. For example if a person working for a company like Microsoft invents a new computer software program at work, the Microsoft company would own the copyright. Length of copyright protection. Copyright laws usually only protect the owner of copyright for a set period, such as 50 years. This period has now been extended to 70 years in most cases. When the period of copyright protection has ended, the written document, musical composition, book, picture, or other creative work is in the public domain. This means that no one owns the copyright to them, and everyone is free to copy, use and change them without having to ask for permission or pay the owner. Fair Use. There is an exception to the rules of copyright, called fair use. This means that people can copy a very small amount of a work to use in reviews or in research reports. An example of fair use is when newspaper writers quote several sentences from a copyright-protected document to tell the story. Another example of \"fair use\" is when a university professor quotes several sentences from a copyright-protected book in a review of the book, or in a research report. Copyright in different countries. Because of these differences, a certain piece of work may be under copyright in one country, and in the public domain in another. Creativity. Some people argue that copyright laws make it easier for people to make new works and think of new ideas. After all, if authors get to make money for the time, effort and money they put in, then they will want to make more works later, and make more money. But others believe that copyright laws make it harder to be creative. Without copyright, other people could change ideas, works and inventions and make them better, and copyright law often stops that. Publisher control. If an author wants to sell a work, it's often easiest to give the copyright to a publisher. The publisher will do all the selling, and in return for that service, will keep part of the money. But the publisher has many different things to sell, and they may not want to sell the work the author made. Authors often find it very hard to find a publisher willing to sell their work. But without a publisher, it can be even harder for an author to sell his or her work. In many markets, a few big publishers own the copyrights to almost everything available, and stores will not want to sell works published by small authors themselves. Many people say copyright law helps big publishers stay in control, and keeps smaller authors out of the market.",
   "Republic of China": "The Republic of China (Taiwan) (ROC (Taiwan)) (Traditional Chinese: \u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b, Simplified Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u56fd, Pinyin: Zhonghua Minguo) is a democratic island country in East Asia that is known around the world by most people as Taiwan. It located southeast of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Territory. The ROC used to govern Mainland China too. Now it is owned by the Communist People's Republic of China see History and Political problems of China. History. The Nationalists, led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, got rid of the Qing Dynasty ruled by the Manchus, then they established the ROC and ended Imperial Dynastic Rule in late-1911. The ROC at that time had Mainland China and all of what is now called Mongolia. After the Japanese were defeated by the Allies during World War II, Taiwan was controlled by the ROC. In 1949, the Chinese Communists fought a war against the Nationalists and won. They established the People's Republic of China. The Nationalists left mainland China while having the lands they control now. Politics. After the ROC created a base on Taiwan, it hoped one day to capture the Mainland. But Chinese Communists grew stronger, so the Nationalists never did go back. The Communists say they replaced the ROC as the only government of China and also calls Taiwan their own. There are those people in Taiwan who want to never be a part of the People's Republic of China. They believe in complete Taiwan independence and want to rename the ROC (Taiwan) to \"Republic of Taiwan\" so Taiwan can no longer have any ancestral connection to China or Chinese culture. Some other people (about 10%) wishes to unite with the People's Republic of China; they want Chinese unification. But most Taiwanese (over 70%) want the \"status quo\": for the Republic of China (Taiwan) to remain an independent democratic country like it is now, without changing the name to Republic of Taiwan. Language. Most Taiwanese speak Chinese, and others speak Taiwanese or Hakka. A small percentage of the population is aboriginal, and these people have their own languages, although unfair treatment exerted by the Chinese population have been bad, and many of these people, and their languages, struggle to survive. Some older Taiwanese who went to school before 1947 can speak Japanese. After the Nationalist government fled the Mainland in 1948-49, they brought their language, Mandarin with them, and made Mandarin the only official language. Thereafter everyone in the ROC had to learn Mandarin. In the past, students were prohibited from speaking their mother tongue in school and were expected to speak only Mandarin. Taiwanese, Hakka, and native languages were considered bad until the early 1990s, when education in these languages began to be taught in some school systems. They were promoted, but by this time, many young people could speak only Mandarin. The Cantonese language, spoken in parts of southern China (for example, the province of Guang Dong, and the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong), is not spoken in Taiwan.",
   "Mexico": "Mexico is a big country in North America. North of Mexico are the United States, south of Mexico are Guatemala and Belize. Mexico is between the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. People living in Mexico or who are from there are called Mexicans. Most Mexican people speak Spanish. There are also Mexicans who speak Native American languages, like Nahuatl, Maya, and Zapotec. The capital of Mexico is Mexico City. History. Before the Europeans came, many great Native American cultures existed in Mexico. The earliest was the Olmec culture. The Olmecs are famous for the large stone heads they made. On the Yucatan peninsula lived the Mayans. The Mayans lived in city states ruled by kings. The Mayans were most powerful between 200 and 900 A.D. Another powerful culture was the one of Teotihuacan. Teotihuacan was a very large city, one of the largest that time. After Teotihuacan declined the Toltecs became powerful. Toltec influence has been found from the southern parts of the U.S. all the way to Costa Rica. A famous Toltec ruler was Quetzalcoatl. The Toltec culture declined too, and it was succeeded by the Aztecs. The Aztecs called their own empire Mexico. A famous Aztec king was Montezuma II. In 1519 the Spanish explorer Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s came to Mexico. The Aztecs thought he was the returned Quetzalcoatl, so they did not want to fight against him. Cortes allied himself with the enemies of the Aztecs. In 1521 they conquered the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan. The Aztec Empire became part of Spain. It was called New Spain. In 1810 the Mexican priest Miguel Hidalgo started the Mexican war of independence. In 1821 the Spanish finally retreated and Mexico became independent. The first leader of independent Mexico was Agustin de Iturbide, he became emperor. But the Mexicans were not happy with him, and in 1823 the country became a republic. A man who was very important in Mexico in the early 19th century was Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna. He was the president of Mexico 11 times. When he was president Texas declared independence (1836). In this war the famous Battle of the Alamo took place. Between 1846 and 1848 there was war between Mexico and the United States again. In this war Mexico lost many areas. After this war Santa Anna was sent away to Venezuela. Between 1858 and 1861 there was war again, between liberals and conservatives. The liberal Benito Juarez won the war and became president afterwards. Juarez stayed president until France invaded Mexico and made Maximilian of Habsburg emperor. But Maximilian was very unpopular. He was executed in 1867, and Juarez became president again. Conservatives thought Juarez had too much power. In 1876 they ousted him, and made Porfirio Diaz, a general who had won a battle against the French, president. Porfirio Diaz made the country wealthier, but the poor people became poorer. The poor were so unhappy they started the Mexican Revolution in 1910. The next 10 years the country was in chaos. There were many presidents who ruled for a short time and all kinds of people fought against each other. Famous people from this period are Emiliano Zapata, Pancho Villa and Francisco I. Madero. When \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n became president in 1920 the fighting calmed down. In 1929 President Plutarco El\u00edas Calles founded the National Mexican Party, PNM. The party was later renamed Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI. The party would rule for a very long time. Most PRI presidents weren't popular, it was said that they were only president to become richer themselves. An exception was president L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas. He was president between 1934 and 1940. After several decades more and more people became unhappy with the PRI. In 1968 security forces shot at protesters, this caused several hundred deaths and became known as the Tlatelolco massacre. Another uprising was in 1994 when Zapatistas rebelled in the province Chiapas. Mainly through ballot box fraud the PRI managed to stay into power until 2000, when Vicente Fox of the National Action Party, PAN, was elected president. In total the PRI had governed Mexico for 71 years. Politics. Mexico is a constitutional federal democracy ruled by a president. The president is elected every 6 years. The current president is Felipe Calder\u00f3n. He has spoken against American plans to build a wall between the two countries to slow illegal immigration. Geography. Mexico is in the southern part of North America and is roughly shaped like a triangle. Mexico is more than 3000 km (1,850 miles) long from northwest to southeast. Mexico is between two large seas: the Pacific Ocean in the West and the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea in the East. Mexico has two large peninsulas. Baja California in the Northwest, and Yucatan in the Southeast. In central and western Mexico are the Sierra Madre mountains. In the Sierra Madre is the Pico de Orizaba, the highest mountain of Mexico. In central Mexico there are also a few volcanoes like the Popocat\u00e9petl and the Iztacc\u00edhuatl. The Pico de Orizaba is also a volcano. In the north of Mexico are deserts, in the south are tropical rainforests. Some rivers in Mexico are the R\u00edo Bravo (known in the US as the Rio Grande), the R\u00edo Grijalva, the R\u00edo Balsas, the R\u00edo P\u00e1nuco, and the R\u00edo Yaqui. People. Mexico is the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world. It is also the second most populous country in Latin America (after Brazil). 60% of the Mexicans have Native American and European forefathers, they are called mestizos. Almost 15% of the Mexicans are pure Native American and 10% are European. Most Mexicans (90%) speak Spanish. 10% of the Mexicans speak a Native American language, like Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, Maya or Zapotec. Most people in Mexico are Roman Catholic (89%). 6% are Protestant.",
   "Mercury (element)": "Mercury is a chemical element. Its symbol on the periodic table is Hg, and its atomic number is 80. It is a very poisonous silver-colored metallic liquid sometimes used in the manufacture of measuring instruments such as thermometers. It is also known as quicksilver Before better compounds were discovered, some mercury compounds were used in medicine to kill germs on the skin. Mercury was known to the ancients and its discoverer is unknown. It is the only metal, and except for Bromine, the only element known that is liquid under what is known as \"normal conditions\" (room temperature, normal pressure). The symbol \"Hg\" stands for its Latinized Greek name \"hydrargyrum\", meaning watery or liquid silver. It is very poisonous.",
   "Africa": "Africa is the second largest continent in the world. It makes up just over a fifth of the world's land. It is surrounded by large areas of water. There are 61 countries in Africa, and 14% of the world's population live there. It is thought to be the continent where the first humans came from. North or Saharan Africa. Much of North Africa is dry and warm, as it is dominated by the Sahara Desert and does not receive a monsoon season. In Saharan Africa there are few rivers or other water sources for the people. The reason it is so warm and dry is because the continent is very wide - this means it is far away from the ocean, which brings rain and wind. Underground water sources, such as springs are very important in the desert. These often form oases. An oasis is an area of vegetation (plant life) surrounded by desert. Countries that are in the North, but are not part of the Sahara desert, are still affected by the very dry wind from the desert. These are very warm areas of the earth, and at the centre of the tropics is the equator (represented by the red line on the right). These lines do not really exist, they are used by people to show where the sun's rays are most powerful. In the extreme north, the climate is cooler and similar to the climate of European Mediterranean countries. Animals. Africa has a lot of wildlife. There are many types of animals there. Some are cheetahs, elephants, lions, snakes, giraffes, and a lot more. Over 2,000 types of fish live in African lakes and rivers.",
   "Butter": "Butter is a dairy food product, made by churning the cream obtained from whole milk. It is commonly used as a spread on bread and a main ingredient in biscuits, as a shortening agent in some baking and cooking recipes, and sometimes as a frying medium. Butter is nearly pure fat, so margarine, which has less fat and cholesterol, might be a heathier choice for some people. It also is usually cheaper.",
   "Mainland China": "Mainland China is the part of China not including the Republic of China controlling Taiwan, Kinmen, Matsu, and the Pescadores. The term also excludes Hong Kong and Macau. In the Qing Dynasty, all of Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Kinmen, Matsu, the Pescadores, and Mongolia were part of the Chinese Empire. Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau were given to foreigners for some years (Taiwan to the Japanese, Hong Kong to the British, and Macau to the Portuguese). By the end the Qing Empire, China became Nationalist China (the Republic of China) and it got Taiwan back in 1945. After the Communists (the People's Republic of China) took over most of China, the Nationalists kept only Taiwan, Kinmen, Matsu, and the Pescadores. Mongolia became an independent state later. Since then, Communist China only includes the part on the continent (mainland) and some small islands that are very near (the largest communist island is Hainan). This region is Mainland China. Later Hong Kong and Macau returned to the government of China, but sometimes they are still not thought of as part of Mainland China.",
   "Endogenetic process": "The endogenetic processes are the processes that shape the land by forces coming from within the earth (endogenetic forces). There are 3 main endogenetic processes: folding, faulting and vulcanicity. They take place mainly along the plate boundaries, which are the zones that are not stable. Endogenetic processes cause many major landform features.",
   "Capital (city)": "The capital city (or just capital) is a city where the central government of a country, or part of a country, such as a state, province, or county, is located. The leaders and officials work in the capital city. Capitals are usually large cities. For example, Montevideo is Uruguay's biggest city, and Uruguay's capital. However, a capital is not always the largest city in a country. For example, the capital of the the Republic of India is New Delhi, which is smaller than Mumbai, and the capital of Pakistan is Islamabad, which is smaller than Karachi, both Mumbai and Karachi are very big cities. Some countries have more than one capital, like Bolivia, which has two, and South Africa, which has three. Nauru is a country that does not have a capital. Some countries change capitals from time to time. Do not confuse \"capital\" with \"capitol\", which is a building in the capital of the United States of America.",
   "Faulting": "A fault, strictly speaking, is a planar fracture through a rock, wherein the motion along the fracture is in the plane of the fracture. If there is no relative sliding motion along a fracture, that is, it only opens, it is a joint. Faulting occurs when shear stress on a rock overcomes the cohesion and frictional force on the rock. The fracture itself is called a fault plane, although it is not necessarily planar. When it is exposed at the earth's surface, it may form a cliff or steep slope called a fault scarp. The angle between the fault plane and an imaginary horizontal plane is called the dip angle of the fault. Faults may dip shallowly or steeply. Faults are generally categorized in three types, depending on the orientation of the fault plane, relative to the direction of motion on the fault. A normal fault is one where the fault dips toward the downthrown block. Motion on normal faults produce overall extension and thinning of the crust. Normal faults characterize rifted terranes, such as Mid-Ocean Ridges, the African Rift, and the Basin and Range Province of western North America. It is shown on geologic maps as a black line with either a block pattern on the downthrown side, or the letters U/D showing the upthrown and downthrown sides. A reverse fault (if steeply dipping) or thrust fault (if shallowly dipping) is a fault where the fault plane dips toward the upthrown block. It is shown on the geologic map with triangular teeth pointing toward the upthrown side of the fault. Reverse and thrust faults effectively shorten (horizontally) and thicken the crust. They are characteristic of collisional origins. A transform (oceanic) or strike-slip (continental fault is one where the relative motion is horizontal. The fault plane is usually vertical. Famous examples of these include the San Andreas Fault of California, the Alpine Fault of New Zealand's south island, and the Anatolian Fault in Turkey.",
   "Fold (geology)": "Folding is one of the endogenetic processes. When two forces act towards each other from opposite sides, the rock layers will be bent into \"folds\". The process by which folds are formed due to compressional force is known as folding. There are large-scale and small-scale folds. Large-scale folds are found mainly along destructive plate boundaries. Structure of a fold. The upfold is called an anticline. The downfold is called a syncline. The imaginary line joining the highest points along the upfold is called the crest line. The flanks of a fold are known as the limbs. The central line from which the rock strata dip away in opposing directions is called the axis of fold. According to the degree of folding of the layers, folds can be classified into five main types. Formation of a fold mountain. Large depressions called geosynclines form between plates. Seas filled the geosynclines and rivers flowing into them carried sediments (sand and silt) which build up on the sea bed. Over millions of years the sediments were compressed, by their own weight, into sedimentary rocks, e.g. sandstone, limestone etc. Landforms formed by folding. Large-scale folding will develop parallel ranges of round-top mountains along destructive plate boundaries. These mountains are known as fold mountains.",
   "Vulcanicity": "Vulcanicity (also known as volcanic activity or igneous activity) is one of the endogenetic processes. Magma under the crust is under very great pressure. When folding and faulting occur, cracks or fractures which are lines of weakness. When these lines of weakness develop downward in the crust and reach the magma, they will release the pressure in the magma. This allows magma to rise up along the lines of weakness and intrude into the crust. Some magma may even reach the earth's surface. There are two types of vulcanicity: intrusive and extrusive. Intrusive volcanicity. Intrusive vulcanicity refers to magma (molten rock) being forced into the rocks that make up the Earth's crust. It occurs when there are lines of weakness such as faults, joints, or bedding planes in the crust. Then magma enters these lines of weakness. When it cools and become solid while still underground, different features called plutons are formed. The rock formed is intrusive igneous rock. These plutons will be exposed at the surface of land when the overlying rocks are removed after a long time of denudation (laid bare by erosion). Major features formed by intrusive volcanicity include: batholith, laccolith, dike, pipe and sill. Extrusive volcanicity. The magma under great pressure with molten materials forces its way through the fissure of the underground rocks and reaches the earth's surface to form igneous extrusion. When the molten materials reaches the surface, it is called extruded materials and such volcanic activity is known as extrusive or surface vulcanicity.Some people classified extrusive vulcanicity into vent eruption and fissure eruption depending on how the magma rising to the ground. Major extruded materials include gas,liquid and solid. When uprising magma decreases in pressure suddenly,gases within magma explode to the earth's surface and cause destruction. Solid - pyroclast:Mainly composed of: fragments of country-rock,solidified lava and fine materials of volcanic ash and dust.It can be classified in term of size into volcanic bombs,volcanic blocks,lapilli,volcanic ash and volcanic dust. Liquid - lava,hot spring.",
   "Pacific Ocean": "The Pacific Ocean is the body of water between Asia and Australia in the west, the Americas in the east, the Southern Ocean to the south, and the Arctic Ocean to the north. It is the largest named ocean and it covers half the surface of the entire world. It joins the Atlantic Ocean at a line drawn due south from Cape Horn, Chile/Argentina to Antarctica, and joins the Indian Ocean at a line drawn due south from Tasmania, Australia to Antarctica. As the Atlantic slowly gets wider, the Pacific is slowly shrinking. It does this by folding the sea floor in towards the centre of the Earth - this is called subduction. This bumping and grinding is difficult so there are many earthquakes and volcanoes when the pressure builds up and is suddenly released when the rocks break. When an earthquake happens under the sea, the sudden violent jerk causes a tsunami. This is why tsunamis are more common around the rim of the Pacific than anywhere else. Many of the Earth's volcanos are either islands in the Pacific, or are on continents within a few hundred kilometres of the ocean's edge.",
   "South Pole": "The South Pole is the most southern point on the Earth. It is also known as Antarctica In fact, there are two main south poles. One is fixed, and one moves around. The Magnetic North and South Poles are where a magnetic compass points. These poles move from year to year. People can tell they are near these poles by looking at a compass. From the South pole, everywhere is North (but a compass is not reliable very close to the poles)! The Geographic North and South poles are the poles the earth spins aroud, the ones people see on a globe where all the north/south lines meet. These poles stay in the same place, and are usually the ones we mean if we just say North or South Pole. People can tell that they are at these poles by looking at the stars (at the poles, a star just circles around at the same height, never dipping to the horizon). Antarctica, is a very cold place. For many weeks in the middle of winter, the sun never rises. In the middle of summer, late December through late March, the sun never sets. At the pole itself, there is a six-month winter where the sun never rises. Once the sun does come up, it is the beginning of a six month summer where a person can stand there at any hour on the clock and observe the sun above the horizon appearing to slowly travel counter-clockwise around him. The South Pole is hard to reach. Unlike the North pole, which is covered by the sea and flat sea-ice, the South Pole is on a mountainous continent. This continent is called Antarctica. It is covered by thick ice (more than a mile thick in the centre). The south Pole is very high up, and is very windy. It is far from places where people live, and ships going there often have to find their way through thick sea ice. Once ashore, land-travelling explorers have to travel more than a thousand miles to get to the pole. They must cross a floating ice shelf, then up onto the ice-covered land, up steep mountain glaciers covered in broken, twisted ice slowly sliding to the sea, and across a high level land (\"plateau\") covered in ice and swept by strong freezing winds. Two expeditions in the early years of the century, led by Robert Falcon Scott and then Ernest Shackleton, failed to reach the South Pole, but returned safely. Shackleton turned back quite close to the pole, but it was late in the season and supplies were low. He knew that he would be risking the lives of his men: to his credit, he turned back. The first men to reach the South Pole were a group from Norway led by Roald Amundsen. They arrived at the Pole on December 14, 1911 and left the Norwegian flag. Amundsen and his men returned home safely. Amundsen's story is one of excellent planning, good leadership, and willingness to learn from others: this made extreme endurance unnecessary, and perhaps made the successful expedition less of a story, and therefore perhaps less famous, than the next one. The most famous South Pole expedition is perhaps the one that failed badly. This was the British expedition (not just UK, it included people from the British Empire, who at that time were considered British citizens) led by Robert Falcon Scott. Scott and four other men, dragging their equipment on sledges, had hoped to be first to the Pole. When they arrived there, they saw a Norwegian flag. A letter left for Scott showed that Amundsen and his men had beaten them by a month, by using dogs to pull their sledges. On their journey back from the Pole, Scott's team found that food \"dumps\" were short of supplies, particularly kerosene. Kerosene was very important: not just for cooking but for melting ice. Once it ran out, they would have no water to drink. One man collapsed and died while walking. Oates knew his frostbitten feet could not carry him back to base, and that he might delay his companions and risk their lives. He committed suicide by walking out of their tent into the cold. Scott and his remaining two companions died of starvation, thirst, and cold - trapped in the tent by bad weather until their supplies ran out. Next spring, the three bodies in the tent were found by a team from the main part of the expedition - who had spent the winter in the expeditions's hut by the sea. Scott's letters to his wife, written in the tent when he knew he was going to die, have just (Jan 2007) been made public. Apart from Shackleton's expedition to cross the Antarctic (another heroic failure, but Shackleton saved all his men, after a very courageous sea crossing in an open boat, and a crossing of an unknown mountain range while starving and freezing) this was the end of the \"heroic\" age of exploration. Motors, Planes, Radios, and GPS ensured that following expeditions were never truly \"unsupported\". Today there is an American science base at the South Pole. It is named the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station to honor the two explorers.",
   "Arctic Ocean": "The Arctic Ocean is the ocean around the North Pole. The most northern parts of Eurasia and North America are around the Arctic Ocean. Thick pack ice and snow cover most of this ocean. An icebreaker or a nuclear-powered submarine can use the Arctic Ocean to go between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The ocean's area is about 14.056 million sq km, which is the smallest of the world's four oceans, and it has of coastline. The central surface covered by icepack about in thickness. The biology there is quite special. Some endangered animals there include walruses, whales and polar bears. The average depth of the Arctic Ocean is. The deepest point is in the Eurasian Basin, at.",

   "South America": "South America is the continent located to the south of America. These two continents are separated by the Panama Canal. It is bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the east by the Atlantic Ocean.",
   "Bed": "A bed is a piece of furniture. It is used for sleeping on.",
   "Asia": "Asia is the largest continent on Earth, placed in the northern hemisphere. It is connected to Europe in the west. Together, Asia and Europe are called Eurasia. Asia is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, the Arctic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean. It is separated from Europe by the Caucasus Mountains and the Ural Mountains. Some of the oldest human civilizations began in Asia, such as Sumer, China, and India. China and India are also the two countries with the most people in the world. A long, mainly land border in the west separates Europe and Asia. This boundary runs North-South down the Ural Mountains in Russia, along the Ural River to the Caspian Sea, and through the Caucuses Mountains to the Black Sea. About three-quarters of Russia lies in Asia, while the rest is in Europe. Small parts of four other Asian countries are in Europe. The Asian continent is the largest of all continents. Covering about 3/10 of the world's land area, it has more people than any other continent with about 3/5 of the world's total population. Stretching from the icy Arctic in the north to the hot and steamy equatorial lands in the south, Asia contains huge, empty deserts, as well as some of the world's highest mountains and longest rivers.",
   "Wall": "A wall is a vertical dividing surface. It divides space in buildings into rooms or protects or pictures a space in the open air. It is usually made of stone or brick. Walls have 2 main purposes: to support the top part of buildings, and to divide space, giving protection from invasion and weather. Before artillery was invented, many cities in Europe had protective walls. Since they are not suitable for defense any more, the walls have been destroyed. The term \"the Wall\" usually referred to the Berlin Wall, built during the Cold War, which fell in 1989. See also: fire wall, Wall painting, wallpaper, Great Wall of China and Western Wall in Jerusalem.",
   "Sociology": "Sociology is the study of societies and how humans act in groups. Sociology is a social science. Auguste Comte (1789 - 1857) was first to use the term. The problems caused by the change to an industrial society, where many people moved to cities and worked in factories, was an early focus of sociology. Karl Marx, Max Weber and Emile Durkheim were leading figures in the study of social phenomena. Themes included: community, authority, status, \u201calienation\u201d (isolation) and lack of power. In the 2000s, sociology looks at such things as: race, ethnicity, class, gender, the family and social interaction. It also studies the breakdown of social structures; crime and divorce. Sociology can also be looked at as the study of the world-wide society. A society is the community of people living in a particular country or region and having shared customs, laws, and organizations. What do sociologists do? Sociologists research the structures that organize society, such as race, gender (whether a person is male or female), and social classes (rich or poor). They study the family and examine problems such as crime and drug abuse. Most sociologists work in one or more specialty areas or \"sub-fields\". Sociology includes many sub-fields that examine different aspects of society. For example, social stratification studies inequality and class structure in society. The field of demography studies changes in a population size or type. The field of criminology examines criminal behavior and crime. Political sociology studies government and laws. Sociology of race and sociology of gender examine how people think about race and gender. Many sociologists also do research outside of the university. Their research helps teachers, lawmakers, and government administrators to make better institutions, government programs, and rules. Sociologists often use statistics to count and measure patterns in how people act or behave. Sociologists also interview people or hold group discussions to find out why people behave in certain ways. Some sociologists combine different research methods. History of sociology. Social analysis has been done since the time of Plato, an ancient Greek philosopher. Sociology became a type of science in the early 1800s. European cities were changing as many people moved into cities and began working in factories. Sociologists tried to understand how people interacted and how groups interacted. The word sociology was invented by a French thinker called Auguste Comte in 1838. Early 1900s thinkers who wrote about sociology included Karl Marx and Max Weber. Sociology was taught in a university for the first time at the University of Kansas in 1890. The first European department of sociology was founded in 1895 at the University of Bordeaux by \u00c9mile Durkheim. The first sociology department to be established in Britain was at the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1904. In 1919 a sociology department was established in Germany at the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich by Max Weber.",
   "Germany": "The Federal Republic of Germany also called Germany (German: Bundesrepublik Deutschland also called Deutschland) is a country in the middle of Europe. It is an important country in international politics. To the north of Germany are the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the country of Denmark. To the east of Germany are the countries of Poland and the Czech Republic. To the south of Germany are the countries of Austria and Switzerland. To the west of Germany are the countries of France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands. West Germany was one of the countries that started the European Union. History. Germany gained importance as the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation,which was the first \"Reich\" translated as kingdom. It was started by Charlemagne who became the first Holy Roman Emperor in 800 AD, and it lasted until 1806 the time of the Napoleonic Wars. The second \"Reich\" was started with a treaty in 1871 in Versailles. The biggest state in the new German Empire was Prussia. The Kings of Prussia were also \"German Emperors\" they did not call themselves \"Emperors \"of\" Germany\". There were many other kingdoms, duchies and republics in the Empire, but not Austria. Germany stayed an empire with many different kinds of people for another 50 years. The treaty of unification was made after Germany won the Franco-Prussian War with France in 1871. In World War I, Germany joined Austria-Hungary, and declared war on France. The war became slow in the west and was fought in \"trenches\", holes soldiers dug in the ground to protect themselves. Many men were killed on both sides. In the east the soldiers fought normal battles and the Germans won in the east. The war ended in 1918 because the Germans could not win in the west, and Germany's emperor had to give up his power. Germany was put under harsh restrictions, and France took Alsace from Germany. After a revolution, the Second Reich ended and the democratic Weimar Republic began. After the war, there were bad money problems in Germany because of the Peace Treaty of Versailles and the worldwide Great Depression. The \"Third Reich\" was Nazi Germany; it lasted 12 years, from 1933 to 1945. Adolf Hitler became the Head of government, and by the Enabling Act on March 23, 1933, the parliament gave him total control of the country and the government. On March 23, 1933, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which enabled Hitler's government to issue decrees independently of the Reichstag and the presidency; Hitler in effect assumed dictatorial powers. Hitler sought to unify all Germans in one state, and did this by uniting ethnic lands where Germans lived in Austria, Czechoslovakia with the German Republic. But his actions became radical, aggressive, and arrogant. Hitler started to abuse his power and declared himself \"F\u00fchrer\" (dictator). Hitler then started to claim nearby countries to be part of Germany, and took them over, beginning with Poland, and including parts of Russia, and the Baltic states. The invasion of Poland started World War II on September 1, 1939. In the beginning, Germany was winning, and quickly got control of most of Europe and a large part of the Soviet Union. After the decisive Battle of Kursk, the German Eastern Front began a slow retreat until war's end. The reason was because Hitler refused to listen to his generals. On 8 May 1945, Germany gave up after Berlin was captured and Hitler had killed himself a week earlier. Because of the war, Germany lost a lot of German land east of \"Oder-Neisse line\", and for 45 years, Germany was split into West Germany West- and German Democratic Republic East Germany. After the end of Socialism in Europe in 1990, East Germany joined West Germany. The new Germany is an important part of the European Union, a group of countries that want to bring all of Europe together for reasons of politics, defence, and economy. Politics. Germany is a constitutional federal democracy. Its political rules come from the 1949 'constitution' called \"Grundgesetz\" (Basic Law). It has a parliamentary system, and the parliament elects the head of government, the \"Bundeskanzler\" (Federal Chancellor). The current Chancellor, Dr Angela Merkel, is a woman who used to live in East Germany. The people of Germany vote for the parliament, called the \"Bundestag\" (Federal Assembly), every four years. Government members of the 16 Bundesl\u00e4nder work in the \"Bundesrat\" (Federal Council). The \"Bundesrat\" can help make some laws. The head of state is the \"Bundespr\u00e4sident\" (Federal President). This person has no real powers but can order elections for the Bundestag. The judiciary branch (the part of German politics that deals with courts) has a \"Bundesverfassungsgericht\" (Federal Constitutional Court). It can stop all acts by the law-makers or other leaders if they feel they go against Germany's constitution. States. \"Main article: States of Germany\" In these states there are 438 \"Kreise\" (districts). Geography. Germany is one of the biggest countries in Europe. It goes from the high mountains of the Alps (highest point: the Zugspitze at in the south, to the North Sea and Baltic Sea in the north. Between the mountains and the sea are the large forests of the middle part of Germany, and the very low and flat parts of northern Germany (lowest point: Neuendorf-Sachsenbande at. Germany also has parts of Europe's biggest and most important rivers, such as the Rhine, Danube and Elbe. Economy. Germany has the world's third largest technologically powerful economy (only the United States and Japan are more powerful). Bringing West and East Germany together and making their economy work is still taking a long time and costing a lot of money; the west gives about $100 billion to the east a year. Germans hope that because of the new form of money, the Euro used in most countries in Europe, and because Europe is coming closer together, this will help Germany's economy in the early 21st century. People. There are at least seven million people from other countries living in Germany. Some have political asylum, some are guest workers (\"Gastarbeiter\"), and some are their families. A lot of people from poor or dangerous countries go to Germany for safety, but today the number is smaller (about 50,000 in 2003). About 50,000 ethnic Danish people live in Schleswig, in the north. About 60,000 Slavic people, Sorbs, live in Germany too, in Saxony and Brandenburg. About 12,000 people in Germany speak Frisian; this language is the closest living language to English. In northern Germany, people outside towns speak Low Saxon. Many people have come to Germany from Turkey (about 1.9 million Kurds and Turks). Other small groups of people in Germany are Croats (0.2 million), Italians (0.6 million), Greeks (0.4 million), Russians, and Poles (0.3 million). There are also some ethnic Germans who lived in the old Soviet Union (1.7 million), Poland (0.7 million), and Romania (0.3 million) (1980 \u2013 1999 totals). These people have German passports, so they are not counted as foreigners. A lot of these people do not speak German at home. Christianity is the biggest religion; Protestants are 38% of the people (mostly in the north) and Catholics are 34% o.7% of Germans the people (mostly in the south). There are also many Muslims (1), while the other people (26.3%) are either not religious, or belong to smaller religious groups. In the eastern regions, the former territory of GDR (also known as DDR), only one fifth of the population is religious. Germany has one of the world's highest levels of schooling, technology, and businesses. The number of young people who start going to universities is now more than three times as big as it was after the end of World War II, and the trade and technical schools of Germany are some of the best in the world. Germans each make about $25,000 a year, so Germany is a very middle class society. A large social welfare system gives people money when they are ill or cannot find a job, and other things the people need. Millions of Germans travel outside their country each year. Culture. In Germany were born many people important in culture: composers such as Beethoven, Bach, Brahms, and Wagner; poets such as Goethe, Schiller, Heine and Lessing or Brecht; philosophers including Kant, Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche; and scientists including Einstein, Born, Heisenberg and Planck. It was also where the \"Bauhaus\" movement started. In the past, when people in Europe could not speak each other's languages, they used German. Today, many people still learn German in school as a foreign language; it is second after English. Many important people in history are thought of as \"German\", because they are at the heart of German culture, although they did not always live in Germany. Some of these people were Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Franz Kafka, Stefan Zweig, and Copernicus. Religion. Roman Catholicism was the biggest religion in Germany up to the 15th century, but a major religious change called the Reformation changed this. In 1517, Martin Luther said that the Catholic church was greedy and that it used religion to make money. Because of what he said, European and world history changed, and Luther started Protestantism, which is equally big then the Catholic religion in Germany today. The current Pope, Benedict XVI, was born in Germany. Before World War II, about 2/3 of the German people were Protestant and 1/3 were Roman Catholic. In the north and northeast of Germany, there were a lot more Protestants than Catholics. About one percent were German Jews. Germany's constitution says that all people can believe in any religion they want to, and that no one is allowed to step on another person's rights because of the person's religion. Today, Germany has the fastest-growing group of Jewish people in the world. Many of them are in Berlin. Ten thousand Jews have moved to Germany since the fall of the Berlin Wall; many came from countries that were in the Soviet Union. Schools teaching about the horrible things that happened when the Nazis were in power, as well as teaching against the ideas of the Nazis, has helped to make Germany very tolerant towards other people and cultures, and now many people move there from countries that may not be so tolerant. Today, about 2/3 of the German people (more than 55 million people) belong to a Christian church, but most of them take no part in church life. About half of them are Protestants and about half are Roman Catholics. Most German Protestants are members of the Evangelical Church in Germany. About three million Muslims live in Germany.

   "Sky": "The sky is what we call the appearance of a hemisphere over our heads. On a clear day it appears blue. The deepness of the blue increases as we move from the horizon to the point above our head. The sky is blue because of Raleigh scattering. Raleigh scattering defines the amount of scattering of light rays. Since all colors of the rainbow create a white light we should see a white sky, but blue light scatters much more than red. That is why the sky appears blue (on a cloudless day). On a cloudy day, it appears to be grey.",
   "Tone language": "In a tone language (tonal language), different tones (like in music, but not as many) will change the meaning of the words, even if the pronunciation of the word is the same otherwise. English and almost all other European languages are not tone languages at all. Many East Asian languages are tone languages, such as all the Chinese languages, Vietnamese, a small number of Korean dialects. In some languages, pitch accent is important. That means a word's meaning could be different, depending on which syllable is stressed. Examples include Swedish, Norwegian, Serbo-Croatian and Lithuanian. Japanese has a similar system. An example of tone language: in Mandarin, \"ma ma ma ma\" (\u9ebb\u5abd\u7f75\u99ac) mean four different things. If we include numbers that mean the tones, it can be written like \"ma2 ma1 ma4 ma3\", which means \"the hemp's mother scolds the horse.\" Some Romanizations write each tone with a different spelling, so \"ma2 ma1 ma4 ma3\" would be \"ma mha mah maa\" in Gwoyeu Romatzyh Romanization. Most use numbers or accent marks (\"m\u0101 m\u00e1 m\u01ce m\u00e0\" in Pinyin). Some tones may sound alike to people who do not speak a tone language and are easy to forget. So tone is the most difficult part of learning a tone language for many people.",
   "Beer": "Beer is an alcoholic drink. It is made (brewed) with water, hops, barley (types of cereal grains), and yeast (a fungus that produces alcohol). Beer is made when the yeast 'eats' sugar taken from the barley and turns it into alcohol and carbon dioxide. Beer is made by adding warm water to malted barley and other grains. The enzymes in the barley change the malted barley and other grains into simple sugars. This is called the mash. The water is then sparged (drained) from the grain. The water is now called wort. The wort is boiled and hops are added. Hops provide flavour and preserve the beer. After boiling the wort is cooled and yeast is added. The yeast turns the sugars into alcohol and the wort into beer. The earliest records of beer were written around 7000 years ago by the Sumerians. It is said that the Sumerians discovered the fermentation process by accident. It is not known exactly how this happened, but it could be that a piece of bread or grain became wet, and a short time later, it began to ferment and made a pulp that causes drunkenness. A seal around 4,000 years old is a Sumerian \"Hymn to Ninkasi\", the goddess of brewing. This \"hymn\" is also a recipe for making beer. A description of the making of beer on this ancient engraving in the Sumerian language is the earliest account of what is easily recognised as barley, followed by a pictograph of bread being baked, crumbled into water to form a mash, and then made into a drink, that is recorded as having made people feel \"...wonderful and blissful\". It could even be possible that bread was first baked to be a way to make beer that is easy to carry around. The Sumerians were probably the first people to brew beer. They had found a \"divine drink\" -- they felt it was a gift from the gods. Different beers can have different natures, depending on the ingredients used; for example, an ale uses top fermenting yeast. Top fermenting yeasts eat more sugar and produce more alcohol. A lager uses bottom fermenting yeast. Bottom fermenting yeasts eat less sugar and produce a crisper, cleaner taste. Adding hops makes the beer more bitter and aromatic. Specialty malts (different types of cooked barley) produce different flavours and colours. These flavours and colours are most notable in dark beers like Porter and Stout. Different countries have different ways to make beer. In Germany, Austria,Switzerland, Czech Republic, and Slovakia, beer is usually made from just hops, malt, water, and yeast. This is because of the Reinheitsgebot. The Reinheitsgebot says that beer can only be made from hops, malt, and water. Yeast was discovered after the Reinheitsgebot. In Belgium, however, beers are also made with sugar, fruit, and other ingredients. Amount of alcohol in beer. \"Normal\" beers have around 4-6 % alcohol (for the volume, ie. in 100ml beer there is 4-6ml alcohol). In brewing beer, the amount of alcohol can be made more or less quite easily. The Belgian types of beer are made by adding more sugar. Through the fermentation, this will then turn to alcohol. Today, there are beers with between 2% and about 16% of alcohol (about the same alcohol content as wine). Some beer labels say there is no alcohol in them because it was taken out later. This is not completely true, though. Beers \"without alcohol\" usually do have less than 1% of alcohol.",
   "The Americas": "The Americas is a term used to refer to the American supercontinent: the continents of North America, South America, and the isthmus of Central America. The Americas are located in the Western Hemisphere and cover 8.3% of the earth's surface. Notice because this is a plural noun, \"the\" needs to be used in a complete sentence. The word American is usually used to mean a person or a thing from the United States of America. People and things from any country in any of the Americas -- North America, Central America, or South America -- are sometimes called \"American\" or Panamerican.",
   "North Pole": "The North Pole is the northern point of the axis around which the Earth turns. It is located in the Arctic Ocean which receives very little heat from the sun. This means that the Ocean around the pole is always very cold and it is covered by a thick sheet of ice. There is also a Magnetic North Pole. It is near the above North Pole. A compass points toward the magnetic North Pole. There is a star, called the North Star or the Pole Star, that always appears in the sky above the North Pole. For hundreds of years sailors were able to tell how far north they were by seeing how high the North Star appeared in the sky. Polar bears live in the Arctic. They are animals that eat meat, so they need to hunt to remain lively. The bears, in a general way, usually are violent to protect themselves and their cubs.",
   "Plural": "Plural is a form of the noun that shows that there are more than one. The opposite of the plural is the singular, which means there is only one. In some languages a suffix (word ending) is added to a word to show that the word means many. For example, English usually uses \"-s\" to mark the plural. For example, \"cat\" is singular, but \"cats\" is plural. These different numbers will have different suffixes from the plural suffix. Some languages do not have plural endings at all. Some of these are the East Asian languages of Chinese, Korean, and Japanese. So native speakers of these languages can easily forget to use plural.",

   "Southern Ocean": "The Southern Ocean is a rather new term in geography. It means the waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans around the continent of Antarctica out to sixty degrees south latitude. Some people call this ocean the Antarctic Ocean. The total area is 20,327,000 km\u00b2, and the coastline length is 17,968 km.",

   "Nitrogen": "Nitrogen is a nonmetal chemical element. It has the chemical symbol N and atomic number 7. Its stable nuclei typically contains 14 nucleons (7 protons and 7 neutrons). It has 5 electrons in its outermost shell. Air is made up of about 78% nitrogen and about 22% oxygen. Nitrogen is not poisonous. We can safely breathe it when it is a part of air, but we cannot breathe pure nitrogen by itself, because it does not have the oxygen that we need to live. Nitrogen is formally considered to have been discovered by Daniel Rutherford in 1772, who called it \"noxious gas\" or \"fixed gas\". Nitrogen Oxide is a typical medical use for nitrogen, also known as \"laughing gas\" it gives the effect of feeling \"high\", or \"pain-free\".",
   "Spamming": "\"This is about unwanted email. You may be looking for the food.\" Spamming is when one person or company sends an unwanted email to another person. Spam emails are the computer version of unwanted \"junk mail\" that arrives in a mailbox, such as advertising pamphlets and brochures. Spam emails are usually sent to try to get the person to buy something or do something else that will cause gain for the sender. Names. The emails sent when someone is spamming is called spam. The person or company who sent the unwanted email is called a spammer. Uses. Spam emails are often sent to many people at once trying to get them to buy a product or sign up for a service. The people who receive the email did not ask to receive the email, and do not want to receive it. One of the reasons there is so much spam emails around is that it costs very little to send millions of spam messages at once. Spam messages can easily be sent, sometimes even by a special computer program. How spammers find email addresses. The hardest part about spamming is to get the email addresses to send the spam to. Sometimes the spammers do this by searching for emails on the internet, or by buying emails from people who know a lot of them (for example, someone who runs a site that makes users tell them their email address to signup will have a lot of email addresses to sell to spammers). Method one. If the person clicks on the link, it tells the spammers that there is someone at the address. Then the spammers put that person on a list of people who actually read spam messages. Next, the spammers and sell that list to other spammers. The same thing happens if the person sends another email back to the spammer (called \"replying\"), which also tells the spammer the message has been read. Method two. Another trick that spammers use is to put a picture \u2014 even one that cannot be seen \u2014 into a spam message. The picture will have a name that goes with just that one email. When the email is opened, a request will be sent to the server that has that picture to get the image. If they get this request, then they know that you read their email, which could cause a person to receive even more spam email. Other meanings. The word \"spamming\" is also used to describe the act of typing a lot of words or text in Internet chatrooms, so that other people using the chatroom cannot carry on conversations. Spamming in Internet chatrooms is usually considered to be rude. Problems with spam. Computer users at home and in workplaces waste a lot of time opening and deleting spam messages. In some cases, spam emails contain viruses or links to pornography or illegal gambling websites. Spam emails often advertise products or services which are being lied about by the companies sending the spam, such as frauds or scams.",
   "Scurvy": "Scurvy is a disease. It is caused by not eating enough Vitamin C. People who have scurvy get spots on their skin, especially the legs. Their teeth may become loose and fall out. They may bleed from the mouth, nose, and gums (mucous membranes). A person with scurvy will look pale. They will feel sad (see depression). They will not be able to move easily, because their joints hurt. Historically, sailors used to get scurvy because fresh fruit could not be kept for as long as they were at sea. Today it is uncommon in the wealthy countries. Vitamin C administered by mouth or by needle (injection, also known as a shot). The injection almost always cures scurvy in babies. Drinking orange juice is another treatment and works in babies. Before Vitamin C was discovered this was the only treatment. When a person gets help for scurvy, they usually get better very quickly. Babies start eating again after one or two days of help. The symptoms get better within seven days.",
   "Anthropology": "Anthropology is the study of human beings. (In Greek \"Anthropos-\" means \"human\", and \"-logy\" means \"study of\"). Anthropology is a biological and historical social science that helps us learn how groups of people are the same, and how they are different in all parts of the world. Anthropologists do research in many places and study how people live now and how they may have lived in the past (using the study of Archaeology). They research in modern cities, small villages, tribes, and in the countryside. They study how groups of people consider time, space, life, etc.",
   "Education": "Education is teaching and learning skills and knowledge. Education also means helping people to learn how to do things and encouraging them to think about what they learn. It is also important for educators to teach ways to find and use information. Through education, the knowledge of a society, country, and of the world is passed on from generation to generation. In democracies, through education, children and adults are supposed to learn how to be active and effective citizens. Types of education. It is part of the job of an educator, an instructor, teacher, or tutor to create a place for learning. There are many different kinds of education. Formal education. Formal education is usually in school, where a person may learn basic, academic, or trade skills. Formal education begins in elementary school and continues with secondary school. Post-secondary education (or higher education) is usually at a college or university.) Nonformal education. Nonformal education is sometimes called adult basic education, adult literacy education or school equivalency preparation. In nonformal education an adult (or a youth who is not in school) can learn literacy, other basic skills or job skills. Nonformal education can be in small classes or through self study. Informal education. There is also informal education. For example, a parent teaches a child how to prepare a meal. Someone can also get an informal education by reading many books from a library. Informal education is when you are not studying in a school and don't use another particular learning method. Public schooling. Public schools provide a free education through the government. Parents are free to let their children receive a private education, but they must pay for it. In some poorer places, some children cannot go to school, because their countries do not make education available, because their families do not have enough money, or because the children have to work.",
   "Army": "The army is the part of a country's military that fights on the ground. People in the army are called soldiers. Many modern armies have vehicles such as tanks, airplanes, and helicopters to help soldiers fight on the ground. A soldier may be a volunteer (someone who joins something by himself), or he may be drafted (forced by the government to join the army). Forcing men to join the army is called \"conscription\" or \"draft\". Voluntary armies tend to be small by numbers, but high in morale and quality. Drafted armies are large, but often lacking in morale and in quality: it may be very difficult to force someone to risk his life against his will. Often drafted armies use death penalty to ensure the soldiers will fight. A soldier does many things, from shooting enemies, to using binoculars to find out where enemies are. They are used to defend their country, or attack another country's army. It is difficult, and a soldier must be in good shape, both physically and mentally. They almost always move together, and that way the team can do more things, in a safer way. They may be assigned to certain places to guard, or they may be told to search a place, or even attack it. That is up to their commander. Every soldier answers to someone else, so that way, everything is organized. Gear. A soldier is supplied with weapons, such as guns, knives, and other simple gear for surviving in the battlefield, such as food, water, clothes, and tents. They must keep good care of the items. American military. Before a soldier joins the army, he must qualify to be in it first. The person is put through tests, so that the army will know if the recruit can do it or not. This is sometimes called 'boot camp'. He must complete mental tests, and physical tests. It depends on where he is testing that will tell him how hard it will be. He will also take tests to determine what job he will do in the military. For instance, he may work with computers or be a cook for the soldiers, or he may be very good with a rifle and be a sniper.",
   "Argon": "Argon is a chemical element. The symbol for argon is Ar, and its atomic number (or proton number) is 18. It is a noble gas and no electrons or protons can be lost or gained from this atom. Argon atoms are found in air. About 1% of the Earth's atmosphere (the air around us) is argon.",
   "Trade": "To trade is to willingly give things or services and get other things or services in return. For example, a person giving a thing must find another person who wants to get that thing. The giver gets something back in return. Other Words. A trade is also called an exchange or a swap. Trades with Goods, Services and Money. The things that are given from one person to the other are called goods. Services can also be part of a trade. One person can do a job or work for another, and get something in return in a trade. Money can be given in return for a service or for a thing. If money is part of the trade, then the person who gives the money is buying, and the person who gets the money is selling. More Words. A place where trading takes place is called a market. When there is no money involved in the trade, the trade is called barter. If there is money involved in the trade, the trade is called a purchase. In the past people would barter to get what they wanted, instead of buying goods and services. The study of trade is called \"economics\". Countries and Trade. Now trade is not just between people, but also between large companies or even countries. Countries sometimes take some of the money or goods involved in a trade between countries. This is a type of tax called a tariff. Smugglers try to trade without paying tarrifs. A free trade between two countries has no tariff on the trade.",

Norrland in the North, Svealand, the central region, and G\u00f6taland in the South. Military. During many wars, including the Vietnam War and World War II, the country did not take sides. During World War II, it sold supplies to both the British and the Germans in order to protect its neutrality. Sweden is heavily armed for a small country. It even develops its own jet fighters, which most countries do not do.",
   "Capital": "The word \"capital\" is sometimes mistaken with \"capitol\". A capitol is a building in which a legislature meets.",
   "Albert Einstein": "Albert Einstein (March 14, 1879 - April 18, 1955) was a famous scientist. He received the Nobel Prize in 1921 for Physics. Einstein is famous for his theories about light, matter, gravity, space, and time, which helps scientists to understand these things much better than they had before. His theories include the theory of special relativity and the theory of general relativity. His most famous equation is formula_1. It means that energy and mass are different forms of the same thing, and that the amount of energy in a piece of mass is the same as the amount of the mass multiplied by the speed of light times itself (a very big number). His life. Einstein was born at Ulm in W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany on March 14, 1879. He was a very fat baby, with an unusually large head. His family was Jewish but was not very religious. Albert also didn't talk until he was about three, which is very unusual. When Albert was around four, his father gave him a magnetic compass. He was very interested in trying to understand how an invisible force could make the needle move and became interested in studying science and mathematics. This compass inspired him to explore the world. Albert went to a Roman Catholic school. He was not a good student, and many people thought him to be not very smart. When he became older, he went to a school in Switzerland. After he graduated, he got a job in the patent office there. While he was working there, he wrote the papers that made him famous as a great scientist.Einstein had two heavily-disabled children with his first wife Mileva. Liesel suffered from Down syndrome and was brought to her Serbian grandparents. She has been never heard of again. Eduard Einstein was diagnosed with a severe mental illness spending decades in hospitals. Einstein's brain was found severely unusual for a genius. Geniuses' brains are around 1500 to 1600 cm\u00b3. There is an indirect connection between brain size and the size of the neopallium especially important for the brain's higher functions. However,Einstein's brain weight was under-average and showed further signs of degeneration (e.g.Sylvian fissure). In 1917, Einstein became very sick with an illness that almost killed him. His cousin Elsa Lowenthal then nursed him back to health. After this, Einstein divorced Mileva, and married Elsa on June 2, 1919. Just before the start of World War I, he moved back to Germany, and became director of a school there. He lived in Berlin until the Nazi government came to power. The Nazis hated people who were Jewish or who came from Jewish families. They accused Einstein of helping to create \"Jewish physics,\" and German physicists tried to prove that his theories were wrong. Einstein moved to the United States to Princeton, New Jersey after feeling the heat of Nazi Germany and in 1940 he became a United States citizen. During World War II, Einstein wrote to the U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt, to say that the United States should invent an atomic bomb before the Nazi government could invent one first. He was also part of the Manhattan project, which was the project to create the atomic bomb. Einstein died on April 18, 1955 of heart disease. He was still writing about quantum physics hours before he died. The Special Theory of Relativity. The Special Theory of Relativity was published by Einstein in 1905 on a paper called \"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\". It states that both space and time are altered near the speed of light. This means that as you get closer to the speed of 186,000 miles per second, distances appear to stretch, and clocks tick more slowly. Einstein proposed that Special Relativity is based on two ideas. The first is that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in an inertial state of motion, meaning that all observers move in different directions without acceleration. The second idea is that the constancy of the speed of light in a vacuum is always the same. A vacuum is a space without matter. The Special Theory of Relativity also states that every peson has their own time, meaning that one person's clock says something different than another person's clock. The reason for this is time dilation, which can be understood better by the twin paradox. The twin paradox also shows how time has changed because of speed and mass. The faster something moves, or the more mass that it has, makes time go slower for them. You can demonstrate this with a pair of twins. Suppose that Joe and Moe are identical twins. On their twentienth birthday, Joe goes into space in a rocket going close to the speed of light. He stays in the rocket for a while, and then comes back to Earth where Moe is waiting for him. They will discover that Moe is a lot older than Joe because Joe was traveling near the speed of light, and therefore, time goes by much slower for him, due to relativistic time dilation. So, time dilation is the effect that a stationary clock runs slower than a moving clock. Special Relativity also relates energy with mass, in Albert Einstein's E=mc2 formula. Mass-energy equivalence. E=mc2, also called the mass-energy equivalence, is one of the things that Einstein is most famous for. It is a famous equation in physics and math that relates mass to energy. The \"E\" in the equation stands for energy. Energy is a number in which you give to objects depending on how much they change. It is a number given to all physical objects to describe how much potential the object has in order to change. There are three basic forms of energy: Potential Energy, Kinectic Energy, and Rest Energy. When energy moves from one form to another, the amount of energy always remains the same. It can't be made or destroyed. This rule is called the \"conservation law of energy\". For example, when you throw a ball, the energy is transferrred from your hand to the ball as you release it. But the energy that was in your hand, and now the energy that is in the ball is the same number. The \"M\" in the equation stands for mass. Mass is the amount of matter you have in your body. A lot of people think mass and weight is the same thing, but it isn't. An object always has the same amount of mass, even if you were to go to the moon, while the weight of an object changes if you go to the moon. But the mass can change as it gets closer to the speed of light. The object becomes bigger. But mass and weight are also similar in some ways. Because a boulder weighs more than a pebble, it has more energy in it, and therefore has more mass. The c2 in the equation stands for the speed of light squared. To square something means to multiply it by itself, so if you were to square the speed of light, it would be 186,000 miles per second, times 186,000 miles per second. Einstein's equation, E=mc2, implies that an object with mass has energy in its mass, and objects with more mass have more energy. An example of this is a photon. A light photon has no mass, but its energy can act as its mass when it hits something. The equation also says that an object with mass can't go faster than the speed of light. The General Theory of Relativity. The General Theory of Relativity was published in 1915, ten years after the Special Theory of Relativity was created. According to the General Theory of Relativity, the gravitational attraction between masses results in the masses in space and time, meaning that every object is attracted to each other, and that results in space and time. Einstein's General Relativity also explained spacetime. Spacetime is the fact that we have a four dimensional universe, having three spatial(space) dimensions, and one temporal(time) dimension. All physical objects-us, the moon, the sun, the Milky Way, everything, is located inside these three dimensions. Also, mass changes the shape of spacetime to change, making the force of gravity curved. These curves are called gravitational waves, and all moving things follow these curves. Black holes are a major source of gravitational waves. A black hole is an object in the universe that has such a strong pull of gravity, that not even light can escape it. They are formed when giant stars, at least three times the size of our sun, dies. This is called a supernova. Also, general relativity explains gravitational lensing, which is where light bends when a massive object comes near it. This was proven during a solar eclipse, when the sun moved behind the moon, and made light General Relativity also set the stage for the theory of the formation of our universe. This theory is called the Big Bang. General Relativity explained singularities, which is what scientists think the universe formed from. This singularity was small, dense, and very hot. All of the matter that we know today came out of this point 15 billion years ago. Beliefs. Many scientists only care about their work, but Einstein also spoke and wrote often about politics and world peace. He liked the ideas of socialism and of having only one government for the whole world. He also worked for Zionism, the effort to try to create the new country of Israel. Einstein's family was Jewish, but Einstein never practiced this religion seriously. He liked the ideas of the Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza and also thought that Buddhism was a good religion. Even though Einstein thought of many ideas that helped scientists understand the world much better, he disagreed with many scientific theories that were developed later in his life. Many scientific theories discuss things that we cannot know for certain, but only as probabilities. Einstein didn't like these kinds of theories; he thought that it should be possible to understand anything, if we had the correct theory. He once said, \"I do not believe that God plays dice with the Universe.\" Because Einstein helped science so much, his name is now used for several different things. A unit used in photochemistry was named for him. It is equal to Avogadro's number multiplied by the energy of one photon of light. The chemical element Einsteinium is named after the scientist as well. In slang, we sometimes call a very smart person an \"Einstein.\" One of his inspiring sayings is \"There are two ways to live your life, one is as though nothing is a miracle, the other is as though everything is a miracle.\" There is still a strong criticism of Einstein. Ronald William Clark says that Einstein hated Germany and the Germans since his youth. G.O.Mueller wrote a whole encyclopedia refuting Einstein's relativity. G.O.Mueller, Aristotle, Kant, Leibniz say space and time are categories of perception, not distortable \"things\", and not joined together.The speed of light could be higher. Paul Dirac and others thought that constants can change over time, too (e.g. gravitation).G.O.Mueller lists about 4000 Einstein-critical works since 1905, rallying worldwide for rethinking relativity.",
   "Euro": "Euro is the currency (money) of the countries in Eurozone. One euro is subdivided into 100 \"cents\". Because of the number of different languages in the EU, there are different names for this unit (the French call them \"centimes\" and the Spanish \"c\u00e9ntimos\", for example). It was created in 1999, but until 1 January 2002 it was used only for electronic methods. In 2002, 12 countries of the EU (The European Union) got rid of their national currencies completely and adopted euro notes and coins as their only money. There was a change-over period, called the \"transition period\" when both the old national money and the euro was accepted, but by 28 February 2002, all 12 countries were using just euros. In 2007, Slovenia became the 13th country to use the euro. In 2008 Cyprus and Malta became the 14th and 15 countries to use the euro. There are 7 different banknotes, each one with a different colour, size and face value: \u20ac5 (grey), \u20ac10 (red), \u20ac20 (blue), \u20ac50 (orange), \u20ac100 (green), \u20ac200 (yellow), \u20ac500 (purple). Coins are of 8 different amounts: \u20ac0.01, \u20ac0.02, \u20ac0.05, \u20ac0.10, \u20ac0.20, \u20ac0.50, \u20ac1, \u20ac2. On every banknote, there is a picture of a different European building style. All banknotes are the same throughout the entire Eurozone - there are no different designs for different countries, unlike the euro coins. One side of each coin is the same in all euro countries. The other side is different since each country who mints the coins inserts a symbol relating to that country. Today there are 12 different sets of coins. Any of the coins can be used everywhere throughout the Eurozone despite the country-specific symbol on the back. The 10 new European countries that entered the EU in May 2004 are planning to also adopt the Euro. First they must meet some conditions to show that they have stable economies. Symbol. The symbol for the euro is the Greek letter epsilon (E) with two horizontal lines: \u20ac. Some people see it as the Latin capital letter C with an equal sign (=). It is also legal to simply write \"euro\". This is especially useful when the symbol cannot be produced, or the result is not satisfactory. The countries above form the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).",
   "Currency": "Currency is the unit of money used by the people of a country or Union for buying and selling goods and services. Certain currencies are said to be \"pegged\" or \"fixed\" to something, usually another currency. A fixed or pegged currency is one that has a constant value compared to what it is pegged to. For example, the Cape Verdian escudo is pegged to the Euro. If the value of the Euro goes up 1% compared to another form of currency, the value of the escudo goes also goes up 1% compared to that same currency. Many countries have used systems where their money was pegged to something other than currency, for example gold. When they do this, as the value of gold increases, so does the value of their money. Doing this is commonly called using the \"Gold standard\". Most countries do not use the Gold standard now.",
   "Light year": "A light year (or light-year or lightyear) is not a length of time, but the distance that light will travel in one Earth year (365 days), going at the speed of light. One light year is about 6 trillion miles, or 10 trillion kilometers. Because the universe is so big, some things are hundreds, thousands or millions of light years away. Because light that leaves a star 100 light years away will take 100 years to get to us, this means that when we see the star's light, we are actually seeing that star as it was 100 years ago.",
   "Korea": "Korea is a nation in the eastern part of Asia. People have lived in Korea for about 15,000 years. In history, Manchuria and some of Siberia used to be part of Korea. The best silk used to come from Korea. In the 7th century, the people of China also liked the gold workers from Korea. Europeans knew very little about Korea until modern times. The printing machine was made in Korea in 1232 and used metal letters. But the original printing machine, which used wooden letters, was made in China almost 1500 years ago. This was a long time before Gutenberg made the printing machine in Europe. The nation of Korea was made into two countries after World War II. North Korea is in the north. South Korea is in the south. North Korea is ruled by a military dictatorship. South Korea is a democracy. North and South Korea fought each other in the Korean War. South Korea has over 48-million people, and North Korea has more than 23-million. South Korea's biggest city is Seoul. It has more than 10-million people. North Korea's biggest city is Pyongyang. It has less than 4-million people. Korea is famous for its traditional food kimchi. Kimchi is spicy pickled cabbage. Koreans eat kimchi a lot. Koreans eat lots of fish, beef, and chicken along with sticky white rice and kimchi. Pizza and hamburgers are also sometimes eaten but is not common. Birthday food includes seaweed soup eaten the morning of someone's birthday, but it is not common now. Many people say Koreans eat dog meat. Some people do, but it is not common. Only a few people eat dog meat these days. Many people in South Korea speak English and other languages. Children in South Korea learn English and other languages in school. South Korea is an advanced country with large cities, high-speed trains, high-speed internet, and many TV & radio networks. Korean soap-operas are popular around the world. Korean TV commercials are among the most expensive in the world. However, there are still poor areas in Korea. Farmers are not rich and struggle against food from other countries. Gojoseon. Gojoseon is the first state of Korean established at 2333 BCE. The founder of Gojoseon is said to be Dangun (Pronounced \"Dan-Kune\"). People of Korea believe that Dangun established the country on October 3rd, and still celebrate that day as the establishment day of Korea. Gojoseon was destroyed by Buyeo, which was succeeded by Goguryeo, at about 230BCE. Three Kingdoms. Between 57 BC and the year 668 there were three kingdoms in Korea. The names of the kingdoms were: \"Silla\", \"Goguryeo\" and \"Baekje\". In the year 372 the religion Buddhism came from China to Korea. Buddhism was very important in Korea. In the year 660 the kingdom of Silla invaded the kingdom of Baekje. In the year 668 the kingdom of Silla invaded the kingdom of Gyguryeo. The people of Goguryeo ran away and made a new kingdom with the name \"Barhae\". After a little time, the kingdom of Silla invaded the kingdom of Barhae. From the year 681 to the year 935 the kingdom of Silla was the only kingdom in Korea. This time has the name \"Unified Silla\". In the Silla kingdom Buddhism was very important. Goryeo. In the year 918 the kingdom of \"Goryeo\" was made. The name \"Korea\" comes from \"Goryeo\". The kingdom of Goryeo had power until the year 1392. The kingdom of Goryeo wrote the law in books. The kingdom made a big government. Buddhism was very important in the kingdom of Goryeo. Joseon. In the year 1392 a man from the military of Korea went to China. His name was \"Yi Seonggye\". The job of Yi was to speak against China. But Yi made friends with the people in China. When Yi came to Korea, he changed the kingdom. Yi was king. The name of the kingdom was \"Joseon\". In the year 1394, the people of Joseon moved the capital to Seoul. The religion of Buddhism was not important. A new religion Confucianism was important. Confucianism came from China. In the year 1443 the king \"Sejong\" ruled. He invented the Korean alphabet. In the year 1592 and the year 1598 the people from Japan fought Korea. A man from the military made very strong ships. The name of the man was \"Yi Sun-sin\". With the strong ships, the people of Korea won. The people of Joseon were always friends with the people of China. Today, North Koreans use the name Joseon (officially Chos\u014fn) to mean Korea. 19th century. In the 19th century the people of Korea did not want to trade with other people. People called Korea \"Hermit Kingdom\". see hermit The people of the United States wanted to trade with Korea. The people of Japan also wanted to trade with Korea. In the year 1876 the military of Japan fought Korea. Korea and Japan made a contract to trade. In 1895 Japan won a war against China. The name of the war was \"Sino-Japanese War\". The military of Japan killed the Queen of Korea in 1895. The name of the Queen was \"Min\". Korea changed the name to \"Daehan Jeguk\" (kingdom of Korea). The people from Korea made friends with the people from Russia. In 1905 Japan won a war against Russia. The name of the war was Russo-Japanese War. In the year 1910, the emperor of Japan made Korea a colony of Japan. Colony of Japan. Korea was a colony of Japan from the year 1910 to the year 1945. The Japanese occupation was harsh. The people of Korea were forced to study the history of Japan and Japanese. They also stopped the people of Korea from speaking the language of Korea. Many people of Korea had to change their name to Japanese name. The people of Korea were not happy with the Japanese occupation. In 1919 the people of Korea were very unhappy. The people marched in the streets. The people made a big demonstration. The people asked the emperor of Japan to go. The police of Japan were not happy with the people. The police arrested 47,000 people, killed 7,500 people, and injured 16,000 people. When World War II started, the policy of the Japanese government changed. They wanted Korea to be a part of Japan. The government made the religion of Japan the religion of Korea. The people of Korea were stopped from celebrating the festivals of Korea. Many men from Korea went to the military of Japan and went to work in Japan. They worked in mines and factories. The men did not want to go, but the Japanese people wanted to. Some women were forced to work as prostitues for Japanese Soldiers. These women were called \"comfort women\". In the year 1945 Japan lost World War II. The USA and the Soviet Union made a contract. The USA occupied the south of Korea. The Soviet Union occupied the north of Korea. The people from Korea wanted to be free. The USA and the Soviet Union wanted the people of Korea to be free. But in 1945 the USA and the Soviet Union were not friends. The Cold War started. The USA and the Soviet Union did not make a contract. The UN thought that invading Korea would keep South Korea a free country. If this had not happened, South Korea would not be free country today and would be controlled by Communists and starving, much like the North. In 1948 the people in the south made a country called South Korea. The USA helped the people of South Korea. In 1948 the people of North Korea also made a country. The Soviet Union helped the people of North Korea. In 1950 a war started in Korea. The name of the war was the Korean War. The war ended in 1953, but no peace treaty was signed. The line between North and South was the same in the end as it was before the war. No land was lost or gained. Now there are two countries: North Korea (also called the DPRK or Democratic People's Republic of Korea) and South Korea (also called the Republic of Korea).",
   "Switzerland": "Switzerland is a small country in the west of Europe. To the north of Switzerland is Germany. East of Switzerland are Austria and Liechtenstein. To the south of Switzerland is Italy. To the west of Switzerland is France. Switzerland is known for its neutrality. A country is neutral when it does not take sides among the countries who are at war. Switzerland has been neutral for more than 190 years. Many international organizations are in Switzerland. The United Nations has a main office (but not its headquarters) in Geneva. Its predecessor organization, the League of Nations, was headquartered in Geneva. The official name of Switzerland is \"Confoederatio Helvetica\". This is Latin. There are four official languages in Switzerland: German, French, Italian, and Romansh. The capital of Switzerland is Bern. The largest city of Switzerland is Z\u00fcrich. Geography. The area of Switzerland is 41,285 km\u00b2. The land is divided into 26 areas called \"cantons\". The 26 cantons are: Aargau, Appenzell Innerrhoden, Appenzell Ausserrhoden, Basel-Stadt, Basel-Land, Berne, Fribourg, Geneva, Glarus, Graub\u00fcnden, Jura, Lucerne, Neuch\u00e2tel, Nidwalden, Obwalden, Schaffhausen, Schwyz, Solothurn, St. Gallen, Thurgau, Ticino, Uri, Valais, Vaud, Zug, and Z\u00fcrich. Switzerland has 2,889 villages, towns and cities. The mountains are very tall in Switzerland. About 60% of Switzerland is mountain. The Alps are in the center and south of Switzerland. The highest mountain is the \"Dufour Peak\" at 4,634 m. Many of the mountains have ice every day. This ice is called glaciers. The rivers Rhine, Rh\u00f4ne, and many other rivers start in the mountains of Switzerland. There are many lakes in Switzerland. The biggest lakes are: Lake Geneva (\"Lac L\u00e9man\"), Lake Z\u00fcrich, Lake Neuch\u00e2tel and Lake Constance (\"Bodensee\"). There are no mountains in the north of Switzerland resulting in many cities and towns built in the north. The biggest cities are Z\u00fcrich, Basel and Bern. Geneva and Lausanne are big cities in the southwest of Switzerland. The Jura mountains are in the west of Switzerland. People. There are about 7.5 million people in Switzerland. About 64% of the people speak German as their first language, in northern and central Switzerland. 19% of the people speak French as their first language, in the west of Switzerland. 8% of the people speak Italian, in the south of Switzerland. Only 1% of the people speak Romansh, in the southeastern part of Switzerland. Romansh is an old language that is similar to Latin. The people of Switzerland do not speak the same German as people in Germany. The German of Switzerland is difficult to understand for people from Germany. But the people of Switzerland write like the people from Germany. 20% of the people in Switzerland do not have a passport of Switzerland. They come to work in Switzerland. The religion of most people in Switzerland is Christianity. 43% of the population follow Catholicism. 35% of the population follow Protestantism. 2% follow Eastern Orthodoxy. The religion of 4% of the population is Islam. The rest follow other religions, or they have no religion. Switzerland is famous for its chocolate, cheese, banking system, watches and mountains. History. In 1291 people from Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden wanted to be free. They signed a contract to work together called the \"Eternal Alliance\". Together the people could be free from the people of Habsburg, who were very strong. In 1315 the people from the Eternal Alliance fought the Habsburgs in battles at Morgarten, Sempach and N\u00e4fels. The people of the Eternal Alliance won all battles. People from other areas signed the contract. More and more people worked together to be free. In 1648, other countries from Europe made an agreement that Switzerland was free. The name of this agreement was the \"Treaty of Westphalia\". More areas came to be part of Switzerland. In 1798, the military from France invaded Switzerland. The ruler of France was Napoleon. He changed many laws. In 1815 Switzerland again became free from France. Other countries made an agreement that Switzerland was free. The name of this agreement was the \"Congress of Vienna\". It also said that Switzerland was neutral. The constitution of Switzerland that was made in 1848 was replaced in 1999. Switzerland did not fight in World War I or World War II. Since 2002, Switzerland is part of the United Nations. It did not join the United Nations for 57 years because of its neutrality. Government. Switzerland is a republic. Switzerland does not have a normal president. Seven people (called ministers) do the job of president. They are called the Federal Council in English, \"Bundesrat\" in German, \"Conseil F\u00e9d\u00e9ral\" in French, \"Consiglio Federale\" in Italian and \"Cussegl Federal\" in Romansh. Every year one of these people is made president. The president is not more important than the other six people. There are two parts of parliament in Switzerland. The \"Council of States\" and the \"National Council\". Both parts can make laws. There are 46 people in the Council of States. Every canton of Switzerland can send 2 people. Some cantons can only send 1 person. There are 200 people in the National Council. The biggest canton sends most people to the National Council. The smallest cantons only send one person to the National Council. The people of Switzerland can collect signatures if they want to change a law. This is called a \"referendum\". If enough people sign a referendum, the people vote. The people can also collect signatures to change the constitution. This is called an \"iniative\". The constitution is the basic law of a country. Economy. Switzerland is a rich country. Switzerland is not member of the European Union, but it is member of the European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA). The EFTA makes trade with other countries in Europe easier. In 1999 Switzerland and the European Union made a contract. This contract makes trade even easier. The banks of Switzerland are important. There are also insurance companies in Switzerland. Tourism is important in Switzerland. There are many places for tourists. Davos, St. Moritz, Pontresina and Laax are in Switzerland. These towns are important for skiing. Tourists also like Lucerne, Geneva, and Z\u00fcrich. Literature. The literature of Switzerland is divided according to the language used. Most literature was written in German from 1291 until 1798. French became popular in Bern and elsewhere in the 18th century. The Italian language and Romansch-Ladin literature are less important. The Heidi books are among the best known works of Swiss literature. Johann David Wyss wrote the children's book \"The Swiss Family Robinson\".",
   "Toronto, Ontario": "Toronto is the largest city in Canada. It is the capital of the province of Ontario. It is found on the north side of Lake Ontario. Many rivers and creeks flow through the city, making deep ravines. There are many beautiful parks near the ravines. Almost six million people live in and around Toronto. Most big Canadian banks and companies have offices there. Toronto is popular with tourists. Visitors can see the Toronto Islands, which are mostly one big park, by taking a ferry. One of the world's tallest towers, the CN Tower, lets people see far away, if they take an elevator to its higher decks. Toronto has a lot of neighborhoods that are distinctive (very different from each other). A lot of \"Torontonians\" (people who live in Toronto) and visitors think the distinctive neighborhoods make Toronto interesting. In Toronto, there are many interesting museums for art, history and science. These include the Royal Ontario Museum and the Art Gallery of Ontario. There are interesting buildings like the unique City Hall or the SkyDome stadium (now called the Rogers Centre) which has a roof that opens. The Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts which was opened in June 2006 is home to the Canadian Opera Company and the National Ballet of Canada. Visitors to Toronto can also see how the province is run by visiting the legislature in Queen's Park. Toronto has five major sports teams: the Toronto Maple Leafs (hockey), the Toronto Blue Jays (baseball), the Toronto Raptors (basketball), the Toronto Argonauts (Canadian football) and Toronto F.C. (soccer). People have come from around the world to live in Toronto. In fact, more than half the people who live in the city were not born in Canada. This makes it an interesting place to see how different types of people live, to hear their languages, and to try different kinds of food. This is why people say Toronto is multicultural. See Also. List of Municipalities in Ontario",
   "Cat": "Cats, also called domestic cat or house cat (\"Felis silvestris catus\"), are carnivorous (meat-eating) mammals, of the family \"Felidae\". Cats have been domesticated for over 3000 years, and they are popular pets. Cats were first domesticated and kept because they eat mice, but later they were kept because they are friendly and good companions. A young cat is called a \"kitten\". Cats are sometimes called \"kitty\" or \"pussy\". The word \"cat\" is also used for other felines: the big cats (lions, tigers, and others) and wild cats (lynxes, pumas, and others). These big cats aren't tamed and can be very dangerous. There are many different breeds of tabby cats. A female cat is a Queen and the male cat is a Tom. History. Throughout history, people kept cats because the cats hunted and ate mice, rats, and insects. Today, people often keep cats as pets, but there are also cats that live without being cared for by people. These kinds of cats are called \"feral cats\". Today, special food for cats is widely available. Proper feeding will make a cat live much longer compared to hunting or being fed table scraps. Not feeding a cat correctly can lead to problems (see below for health concerns). Cats cannot taste sweet foods (with sugar) because of a mutation (change) in their ancestors which removed the gene necessary for tasting sweet things. Food. There are many different types of cat food. You can buy \"wet\" canned food. These come in many different flavors and costs are often very small. There is also \"dry\" cat food which comes in different sized bags and formulas. There are kitten formulas, cat formulas, health formulas, formulas for reducing a cat's weight, and many others. These can even be organic (made from all natural ingredients), and have vegetables, salmon, tuna, meat, and milk essence. Behavior. Cats are carnivorous; meaning that they tend to eat birds and small mammals (like mice). Cats are quiet and well-behaved animals, so they are popular pets. Many house cats no longer hunt their own food, but eat food that their owner gives them, made in factories. Young kittens are playful. So a lot of pet companies make toys to redeem, or rid of, cats energy without the owner always having to pay attention to it. Grooming. Cats are very clean animals. They groom themselves by licking their fur. The cat's tongue can act as a hairbrush and can clean and detangle a cats fur. Still, many owners buy grooming products so the cat will not always be depended on to take care of itself. After licking their fur, cats sometimes get hairballs. A hairball is a small amount of fur that is vomited up by animals when it becomes too big. Cats are commonly shown coughing up hairballs in comedy shows. Cats are brushed by their owners to try to prevent a lot of hairballs. Pets. House cats are not often taught to do things, but large cats raised by people in enclosed spaces can be taught to do tricks. When a cat is happy, it moves its chest very quickly, which makes a soft noise. This is called \"purring\". Cats are also very clean animals. They lick their fur many times a day, and they like clean places. They also sleep a lot, sometimes up to 18 hours a day. This makes them easy to care for. Health Concerns. Cats, like other living things, can get diseases. When a cat gets a disease,you should take it to a veterinarian (animal doctor). Depending on the way a cat looks, a disease could be more common. For example, blue-eyed cats with white fur can become sick easier then some other cats. Regular visits to a vet can keep your cat alive many extra years by catching sickness and disease early. House cats, can become overweight easily due to less exercise than feral (wild) cats, and from being spayed or neutered. (This sometimes is known as being \"fixed\"). Spaying is done for female cats and neutering is done for male cats. It is important to fix cats to avoid overpopulation which means more cats and dogs to be put to sleep (euthanized) in animal \"pounds\" (pounds are great places to get animals for little money and you will be saving an animals life too!) It then is important to help your cat stay fit by diet and exercise (play is great exercise and no money need be spent to keep a cat entertained -a piece of string can do the trick! Cats can also be born Polydactyl. Polydactyl means many digits, or many \"fingers\" from poly (many) and dactyl (digit). Sometimes there is a mutation (change) in cat families. Most cats have only four toes per paw. These mutated cats have five. Rarely, some are born with more than five toes per paw. All of these cats are called \" polydactyl cats\". They can also be called \"Hemingway cats\" because author Ernest Hemingway owned many of these cats. This mutation can happen in any breed (kind) of cat.",
   "Communication": "Communication can be spoken (a word) or non-spoken (a smile). Communication has many ways, and happens all the time. Not only humans communicate, most other animals do too. Some communication is done without thinking, such as by changing in posture How communication works. Communication works by exchanging information or messages. In very basic terms Besides the content of the message, there are other things that are important. These are not part of the message itself, but rather of its context For a message exchange to be successful, the sender and the recipient must have agreed on a vocabulary. The word \"hedge\" can mean completely different things based on the context. In biology a hedge is a row of shrubs or trees that make a barrier or form a border. In finance, a hedge is an investment made to reduce therisk of another investment. In linguistics a hedge is a word or set of words that make other words less important. Without any information it is therefore very difficult to know which \"hedge\" is really meant by the speaker.",
   "Cardboard": "Cardboard is a heavy wood-based type of paper, notable for its stiffness and durability. It was first invented in China some time in the 15th century, and is used for a wide variety of purposes. One of its more common uses is as a packaging material. Cardboard boxes were first produced commercially in 1817 in England. Corrugated (also called pleated) paper was patented in England in 1856, used as a liner for tall hats, but corrugated cardboard would not be patented and used as a shipping material until December 20, 1871. The patent was issued to Albert Jones of New York City, New York for single-sided corrugated cardboard. Jones used the corrugated cardboard for wrapping bottles and glass lantern chimneys. The first machine for producing large quantities of corrugated cardboard was built in 1874 by G. Smyth, and in the same year Oliver Long improved upon Jones' design by inventing corrugated cardboard with liner sheets on both sides. This was now cardboard as we know it today. The American Robert Gair invented the corrugated cardboard box in 1890, consisting of pre-cut flat pieces manufactured in bulk that folded into boxes. Gair's invention, as with so many other great innovations, came about as a result of an accident; he was a Brooklyn printer and paper-bag maker during the 1870s, and while he was printing an order of seed bags a metal ruler normally used to crease bags shifted in position and cut the bag. Gair discovered that by cutting and creasing cardboard in one operation he could make prefabricated cartons. Extending this to corrugated cardboard was a straightforward development when the material became available. By the start of the 20th century, corrugated cardboard boxes began replacing the custom-made wooden crates and boxes previously used for trade. The \"Kellogg brothers\" first used cardboard cartons to hold their flaked corn cereal, and later when they began marketing it to the general public a heat-sealed waxed bag of Waxtite was wrapped around the outside of the box and printed with their brand name. This marked the origin of the cereal box, though in modern times the sealed bag is plastic and is kept inside the box rather than outside. Cardboard packaging has undergone a minor resurgence in recent times due to the trend towards environmentalism. It is now common for cardboard to be manufactured with a large percentage of recycled fibers.",
   "English language": "The English language is the language started by tribes that moved to Britain from West Germany around 450 AD. Languages started by the German tribes are called Germanic languages. English is spoken in many countries around the world. With around 380 million native speakers, it is the second most spoken language in the world. About 220 million more people speak it as a second language and there are as many as a billion people who are learning. English has been an influence on, and has been influenced by many different languages. History. English began in England, a country on the island of Great Britain in Europe. Germanic tribes (Saxons, Angles, and Jutes) came to Britain from around 449 AD. They made their home in the south and east of the island, pushing out the Celtic Britons who were there before them. The Germanic dialects of these different tribes became \"Old English\". The word \"English\" was then and that comes from the name of the Angles - \"Englas\". Old English did not sound or look much like the English we speak today. If English speakers today were to hear or read a passage in Old English, they might understand a few words, but it would be very hard for most to understand what the passage is about. Many other people came to England later at different times, speaking different languages, and these languages added more words to make today's English. For example, around 800 AD, many Danish and Norse pirates, also called Vikings, came to the country and English received many Norse loanwords. Their languages were Germanic languages, like Old English. After William the Conqueror conquered England in 1066 AD with his armies and became king, he brought his nobles, who spoke Norman, to be the new government. They stopped English from being taught in schools for a long time, and the language changed greatly, because it was mostly being spoken instead of written for about 300 years. English borrowed so many words from Norman at that time that it can be called a different language, Middle English. Geoffrey Chaucer is a well known writer of Middle English. After more sound changes, Middle English became Modern English. Although the works of Shakespeare might seem very old, they are actually called modern. English has continued to take new words from other languages, for example from French, Chinese, Hindi and Urdu, Japanese, and Spanish. Because many scientists from different countries needed to talk to each other, they chose names for scientific things in the languages they all knew: Greek and Latin. Those words came to English also, for example, \"photography\" (\"photo-\" means \"light\" \"and \"-graph\" means \"picture\" or \"writing\", in Greek. A photograph is a picture made using light), or \"telephone\". So, English is a combination of Old English (closely related to German and Dutch), Danish, Norse, and French, and has been influenced by Latin, Greek, Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, and Spanish, and more words from even more languages. The historical stature of the British Empire has contributed to the spread of the English language. English is an important language in many places today, for example in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, the Republic of India and Pakistan, South Africa, and the United States, English is a dominant language. Because the United Kingdom (the country in which England is located) and the United States have historically been economically and politically powerful, many people find it helpful to learn English to communicate in science, business, and diplomacy. This is referred to as learning English as an additional language, English as a Second Language (ESL) or English as a Foreign Language (EFL). Many famous stories and plays are in English. Shakespeare was a famous English writer of poems and plays. Today, many famous songs and movies (cinema films) use the English language.",
   "William Shakespeare": "William Shakespeare (April, 1564 - April 23, 1616) was an English writer. He wrote plays and also some poetry. Many people consider him to be the greatest English writer of all time and one of the greatest in the world. He wrote plays about history and tragedy and he wrote comedies. His poetry and plays are about being human, with feelings such as love, jealousy, anger, and much more. Children learn about him in schools around the world. Shakespeare wrote his works between about 1590 and 1613. Who wrote \"Shakespeare\"? About 150 years after Shakespeare died, some writers began to say that the works we call \"Shakespeare\" were not really written by William Shakespeare. They had various reasons for saying this. For example, the person who wrote \"Shakespeare\" knew a lot about other countries (especially Italy), but William Shakespeare never left England as far as we know. Several other writers of \"Shakespeare\" have been suggested, such as Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, and Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford. Most scholars believe that William Shakespeare did write the works that bear his name, but the idea that someone else \"wrote Shakespeare\" still gets discussed a lot.",
   "Trier": "Trier is a city at the Moselle River in Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany. The population is about 100,000. Trier is famous for some Roman buildings like the Porta Nigra and others. It is famous as the birthplace of Karl Marx. Trier is also famous for the wine of the wine-growing-region Mosel-Saar-Ruwer.",
   "Computer network": "Computers can be part of several different networks. Networks can also be parts of bigger networks. The \"local area network\" in a department store is usually connected to the \"corporate network\" of the parent company, and may have privileges with the corporate network of a bank. Any connected machine at any level of the organization may be able to access the \"Internet\", for example to demonstrate computers in the store, display its catalogue through a web server, or convert received orders into shipping instructions. Microsoft Windows, Linux and most other operating systems use IP for networking. Apple Macintosh computers used Appletalk in the past, but it uses IP now.",
   "Thomm": "Thomm is a village near Trier (at the Moselle River) in Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany. Thomm is famous for an old celtic stone, called \"Hinkelstein\" near the village and a big celtic grave. In further times there was a slate minor industry near Thomm. Thomm is also famous for its cider, an apple-wine. The European Hill Climb Championship comes at June to Thomm and the FIA World Rally Championship in August every year.",
   "Moselle River": "The Moselle River (german Mosel; french Moselle) is a river in France and Luxembourg, that becomes part of the Rhine River after the Moselle flows into Germany.

   "Rome": "Rome (Italian \"Roma\") is the capital city of Italy and the Italian region Latium. It is located on the Tiber river and has 2.8 million inhabitants. The enclave Vatican City is in the north-west. According to legend, Rome was founded on April 21, 753 BC, by Romulus. He killed his twin brother named Remus, with whom he had been raised by a wolf, and became the first king of Rome. Rome was the center of the Roman kingdom, later of the Roman Republic, then of the Roman Empire. Education. Rome is an educational place in Italy. The children in Rome have to start school at the age of six and 14. This takes them to the end of Junior High School. Rome has the biggest university in Italy and it is named University of Rome. It was founded in 1303. About 200,000 students go to study at this University. Transport. Rome has an airport, which is named the Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport (IATA: FCO). See also.

   "Senegal": "The Republic of Senegal (French \"R\u00e9publique du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal\") is a nation in West Africa. The capital is Dakar. Geography. In the north of Senegal is the Senegal River. To the north of the river is Mauritania. The nation borders Mali in the east, Guinea-Bissau in the south, and Guinea in the south-east. The Gambia is another country inside of Senegal, along the Gambia River. It is about 300 km long. The north of Senegal is part of the Sahel. The highest mountain is 581 m high. The rainy season is between June and October. The average temperature on the coast is about 24\u00b0 C, and inland about 27\u00b0 C. History. In the 15th century, Portuguese people came to Gor\u00e9e Island off the coast of Dakar. In the 17th century, French people and Dutch people came there, too. These European countries used the island as a trading post in slaves from the mainland, controlled by the Muslim Wolof Empires. Slavery was later made illegal by France, but soon after, around 1850, the French started to conquer the Wolof. By 1902 Senegal was a part of the French colony French West Africa. In January 1959, Senegal and the French Sudan became one to form the Mali Federation, which became fully independent on June 20, 1960, as a result of the independence and transfer of power agreement signed with France on April 4, 1960. This did not last long and Senegal and Mali broke apart into separate nations. Between 1982 and 1989 Senegal and The Gambia joined together to make Senegambia.",
   "Developmental biology": "Developmental biology is the study of the process by which organisms grow and develop.",
   "Outer space": "Space, also known as the outer space, is the vacuum that all of the planets, stars, galaxies and other objects are in. The planet Earth is in space, and so are all the other stars and planets in the Universe. Space can be thought of as a three dimensional grid in which everything moves about. Everything that exists there is exposed to it, even if it's inside something else. You are exposed to space and are moving through it. How far space reaches is unknown, as the distant edges of the universe have not been examined yet. According to the big bang theory, not even space existed before the universe was created. After the big bang, space expanded outwards to give rise to the vast expanse that is known today. Space, just like physical objects, can be altered. The force which alters space is gravity, and some scientists have guessed that powerful rings of light can also bend space. When space is warped, it can be traveled through in a shorter amount of time relative to the unwarped portion. Scientists have learned with technology that space seems to be made of nothing, so only energy that acts like a particle can travel through it. Examples of energy that behave like particles are light, and x-rays. To compare, sound cannot travel through space because there is nothing there for the energy to move through.",
   "Natural satellite": "A natural satellite is simply called a moon. A moon is a large, usually ball-shaped object that goes around (orbits) a planet. The Earth has only one moon. Some other planets have many moons, and some have none. When people write just \"the\" moon\", they are usually talking about the moon of the Earth. Often Earth's moon is written with a capital letter, like Moon. The Latin word for the moon is \"Luna\", which is why the word used to talk about the moon is \"Lunar\". For example, lunar eclipse. Anything that goes around a planet is called a satellite. Moons are natural satellites. People also use rockets to send machines into orbit around the Earth. These machines are called artificial (man-made) satellites. They help us to communicate, the telephones and televisions need these satellites. Earth's moon. Moons do not make their own light. We can see the Earth's moon because it acts like a mirror, and reflects the light of the Sun. The same half of the moon faces toward Earth at all times, no matter where it moves. But different parts of the moon are lit up by the Sun, so it looks different at different times of the month. This change as seen from Earth is called the phases of the moon, or lunar phases. A moon's cycle is the time the moon takes to change from looking very bright and round to looking very small and thin, and then back to bright and round again. In the case of the Earth's moon, this is about four weeks. It does this about 13 times in one year. The moon's cycle is about 28 days, a bit shorter than a calendar month. The Apollo 11 mission helped Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin become the first people to walk on the Moon. They did this in July 20, 1969. Orbits. The orbit of a moon or other satellite is affected by two forces: gravity, and the centripetal force. For example, the Earth's moon is kept in orbit by the gravitational pull from the Earth. This is also the way the Earth is attracted to the Sun, and stays in its orbit. The orbit of the Earth's moon actually causes the tides and waves on Earth. Moons of moons. No moons that belong to moons have been found. In most cases, the tidal effects of the main body would make such as unstable. However, math completed after the recent finding of a possible ring system around Saturn's moon Rhea show that Rhean orbits would be stable. Also, the rings are thought to be narrow, something that is known with shepherd moons. Asteroid moons. The finding of 243 Ida's moon Dactyl in the early 1990s was the proof that some asteroids have moons; indeed, 87 Sylvia has two. Some, such as 90 Antiope, are double asteroids with two same-sized parts. Moons of the Solar System. The biggest moons in the Solar System (those bigger than about 3000 km across) are Earth's moon, Jupiter's Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto), Saturn's moon Titan, and Neptune's captured moon Triton. The following is a table grouping the moons of the solar system by diameter. The column on the right has some notable planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, and Trans-Neptunian Objects for comparing. It is normal for moons to be named after people from mythology.",
   "Centripetal force": "Centripetal force (or acceleration) is a type of force that acts on any body that revolves around a centre. (circular motion). This force contributes to keeping the body in circular motion. This force is always directed towards the centre. The opposite force (by Isaac Newton's third law of motion) is called centrifugal force. This is the force that acts on the body in a direction away from the centre, which contributes to making the body try to fly away. When you hold a rope with an heavy object attached to it, and rotate it around, the rope becomes taut and keeps the body from flying away. This is caused by centripetal force.",
   "Homonym": "A homonym is a word that sounds the same but has more than one meaning and is spelt differently. For example, right means moral, the opposite of left, and a personal freedom. There are two kinds of homonyms: homophones (they sound the same) and homographs (they look the same).",
   "Peru": "Peru is a country in South America. The capital is Lima. The ruins of Machu Picchu, the Andes mountains, and the source of the Amazon River are all found in Peru. The main language is Spanish, but other languages, including Quechua and Aymara are also spoken. Peru is bordered to the north by Ecuador and Colombia, to the east by Brazil, and to the south by Chile and Bolivia. Peru was ruled by the Inca civilization until the Spanish arrived in 1531. Peru was a colony of Spain until 1821. Peru suffered a terrible guerrilla war in the 1980s. The communist (Maoist)Shining Path tried to take over the country. But after the leader of the group was captured in 1992, Shining Path was not a threat anymore. During the 1990s, it was ruled by President Alberto Fujimori. During this time, the economy of Peru got better, and it became easier to start a company or operate a business. After Fujimori, Alejandro Toledo was elected President, and then Alan Garcia, who was President from 1985 to 1990, was elected again in 2006. Peru's most important exports (products that it sells to other countries) are fish, gold and other metals, oil, coffee, sugar, and cotton. Also, the food in Peru is very diverse, including typical dishes like Ceviche and Broiled Chicken. Tourists from other countries like to come to Peru because of the history and also to enjoy nature. Many people come to climb mountains in the Cordillera Blanca in the Ancash Region, and many people visit Peru's long Pacific coast or the Amazon jungle. Cuzco and Macchu Picchu are just two of the places where many buildings built by the Incas are still standing after hundreds of years, and these are some of the most visited places. The Incas were not the only tribe in Peru who left buildings and artifacts, but they were the most powerful. Peru is divided into 25 regions. Lima is the capital and other main regions are Cuzco, Arequipa and Lambayeque. In the Amazon jungle region, we can find many important rivers and different animals, plants and people of many indigenous cultures. The currency of Peru is the Nuevo Sol.",

   "Emphysema": "Emphysema is a disease of the lungs. It happens when the little air sacs at the ends of your airways in your lungs start to break down. People with emphysema may find it hard to breathe because they trap air in their lungs and have a hard time getting air out of their lungs. Emphysema is one of the diseases referred to as a Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The other disease is chronic bronchitis. Most people get emphysema through smoking. As emphysema progresses over the years, patients with emphysema may find it increasingly difficult to climb inclines and stairs, exercise vigorously, and do physical activities at the pace of those with healthy lungs. Emphysema patients may also need extra oxygen if their lungs are not able to get enough oxygen from their lungs to the rest of the body. People who suffer from emphysema may have swollen legs. This is due to a build up of fluid in the legs (which also may happen in the lungs). Severe cases of emphysema require hospital treatment but there is little they can do to help. The damage cannot be reversed.",
   "Oxygen": "Oxygen (O) is a chemical element. It is one of the gases found in the air. It has no color or smell and cannot be seen. It supports life--animals (including humans) need oxygen to live. The purpose of breathing is to get a fresh supply of oxygen into the body. Oxygen also helps burning. When an oxygen atom forms a molecule with two hydrogen atoms, it becomes Water (H2O). Water is something that all animals need to live. Oxygen was discovered in 1772 by Joseph Priestley. The word oxygen comes from Greek words: oxus (acid) and gennan (generate). Use of oxygen gas. One of the most common is in use under welding, where it is mixed with acetylene to get a very hot flame. Another use is using it in space rockets, as an oxidizer together with the rocket fuel, (hydrogen or hydrazine) to create powerful combustion and propel the rocket forwards at great speeds. Use of liquid oxygen may be problematic because it is so cold- it may cause pipes to freeze or rubber to become porous. It does not burn by itself, but it is what drives a combustion. It is therefore quite dangerous when operating it, as if it leaks a spark or hot part may ignite an explosion. Production of gas. Pure oxygen can be produced in several ways; one is through electrolysis of water to yield O2 and H2 gas. In nature, plants produce it in chlorophyll in their cells from CO2 and water, and with solar energy it reacts to O2 and C6H12O6 (which builds up cellulose molecules.)",
   "1980s": "The 1980s is the ten years from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 1989. This decade (group of ten years) is sometimes called the \"Greed decade\" in English speaking countries. Unlike the 1960s and 1970s, this is when the word \"yuppie\" was used to describe \"young urban professionals\" - young adults who lived in cities and started to get good jobs. This was also the rise of a more conservative period in these countries - Ronald Reagan was president for most of this time in the United States, Margaret Thatcher was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and Brian Mulroney was Prime Minister of Canada. This decade also saw the Soviet Union fight a war that seemed endless in Afghanistan, civil war in Ethiopia, and the fall of the Berlin Wall which started the end of the Cold War and of Communism in Eastern Europe. The \"eighties\" are also well known for their extreme fashions, such as \"big hair\", New Wave, punk rock, funk, or preppies. Rap music first started to get big in the 80s, and often went with breakdancing in what is now called the \"old school\" days. Many developments were also made in computer technology during these years, and video games became popular.",

   "Iceland": "Iceland (Icelandic: \"\u00cdsland\") is a country in Europe. It is in the north of the Atlantic Ocean. Iceland is 300 kilometers east of Greenland and 1000 kilometers west of Norway. Iceland has an area of 39,769 square miles. History. The first people who lived on Iceland were Irish monks. They came to Iceland around the year 800. In the 9th century, the Vikings went to live on Iceland. The first Viking who lived on Iceland was Fl\u00f3ki Vilger\u00f0arson. He was also the one who gave Iceland its name. Ing\u00f3lfur Arnarson, a chieftain from Norway went to live in South West Iceland. He founded the city of Reykjav\u00edk. In 930, the Icelandic rulers wrote a constitution. They created the Althing, a kind of parliament in the town \u00deingvellir. Therefore Iceland is the oldest existing democracy. In 985, Erik the Red was sent away from the island because he had killed someone. He sailed to the west and discovered Greenland. Eric's son Leif Ericson discovered America in the year 1000. He called it Vinland. The voyages of Eric, Leif and others were written down in the sagas (long stories). In 1262, Iceland became part of Norway. In 1662 it became part of Denmark. In the 19th century, many Icelanders wanted to be independent from Denmark. In 1918, Iceland got many powers of its own, but the king of Denmark was still king of Iceland. When Germany took over Denmark on April 9 1940, the Althing decided that Icelanders should rule the country themselves, but they didn't declare independence yet. British and later American soldiers occupied Iceland to prevent it from being attacked by the Germans. In 1944 Iceland finally became fully independent. After World War II, Iceland became a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), but not of the European Union. Between 1958 and 1976 there were three debates between Iceland and the United Kingdom about the rights to catch codfish. They were called the Cod Wars. In 1980, Vigd\u00eds Finnbogad\u00f3ttir was elected president of Iceland. She was the first woman ever to be elected president of a country. People. The people in Iceland are mostly of Scandinavian origin. The language they speak is Icelandic. The language has not changed much in 1,000 years, so Icelanders are still able to read the sagas about the Vikings without many problems. Most people in Iceland are Christian. Most of them are Lutheran. Names. There are no real surnames on Iceland. Children get the first name of their father (sometimes mother) with -son if it's a boy, and -d\u00f3ttir if it's a daughter. For example, a man named J\u00f3n Stef\u00e1nsson has a son named Fjalar. Fjalar's last name will not be Stef\u00e1nsson like his father's, it will become Fjalar J\u00f3nsson. The same goes for women. J\u00f3n Stef\u00e1nsson's daughter Kata would not have the last name Stef\u00e1nsson, she would have the name J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir. In most countries people use to call other people by their surname, but in Iceland people call other people by their first name. So when people talk about Halld\u00f3r \u00c1sgr\u00edmsson they do not call him \u00c1sgr\u00edmsson, but Halld\u00f3r. Towns and cities. Reykjav\u00edk is the capital city of Iceland. Reykjav\u00edk is also the most important port in Iceland. Other important towns in Iceland are Akureyri, K\u00f3pavogur, Hafnarfj\u00f6rdhur, Keflav\u00edk, and Vestmannaeyjar. Geography. Iceland is very geologically active and combined with large amounts of rain and snow caused by the warm waters of the gulf stream current which flow toward it, many interesting and unusual geographic features have developed which make it different from any other island so close to the Arctic Circle. Some of these features are Iceland's numerous mountains, volcanoes, hot springs, rivers, small lakes, waterfalls, glaciers, and geysers. The word geyser is, in fact, derived from Geysir, the name of a particularly famous geyser on the southern side of the island. Glaciers cover approximately 11% of the island and the largest, Vatnaj\u00f6kull, is up to 1 km thick and, by far, the largest glacier in Europe. Iceland, though considered to be a European country, sits partly in North America since it straddles the Mid-Atlantic Ridge which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates. The ridge runs directly through the populated Reykjavik and Thingvellir historic areas, and the tectonic activity of these plates separating is the source of the abundant geothermal energy in the region.",
   "Christianity": "Christianity is a monotheistic religion (they only believe in one god). It is based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. These can be found in the New Testament in the Bible. People that believe in Christianity are called Christians (Greek). They believe that Jesus was born the Son of God and the Messiah (Christ). His birth was prophesied many years before he was born, and can be found in the Old Testament. To Christians, Jesus Christ is a teacher and revealer of what the Christian God teaches. He is an example of how Christians should live. Christians consider him to be the saviour of all people, because he suffered, died, and was resurrected to allegedly save people from sin. Christians believe that Jesus ascended into heaven, and most Christian groups (denominations) believe that Jesus will return to Earth and judge everybody, both alive and dead, giving everlasting life to Christians. Christians call the message of Jesus Christ the Gospel (\"good news\"), that is why the first four books of the New Testament are called the gospels. Just like Judaism and Islam, Christianity is an Abrahamic religion. Christianity started out as a Jewish sect in the eastern Mediterranean. It quickly grew in number of believers and influence over a few decades, and by the 4th century had become the dominant religion in the Roman Empire. During the Middle Ages, the rest of Europe mostly was Christianized. At that time, Christians were mostly a religious minority in the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of India. Following the Age of Discovery, through missionary work and colonization, Christianity spread to the Americas and the rest of the world. Christianity has been an important part of the shaping of Western civilization, at least since the 4th century. As of the early 21st century, Christianity has between 1.5 billion and 2.1 billion followers, which is about a quarter of all people of Earth. Worship. Worship is thought by most Christians to be a very important part of Christianity all through its history. Many Christian theologians have called humanity \"homo adorans\", which means \"worshipping man,\" and so the worship of God is at the very center of what it means to be human. This would mean that because God created all humanity, then Christians should worship and give praise God. Sacraments. In Christian belief and practice, a sacrament is a religious symbol or often a rite which shows divine grace, blessing, or sanctity for the Christian who does it. Examples of sacraments would be Baptism and the Mass.\" The word is taken from the Latin word \"sacramentum\", which was used to translate the Greek word for \"mystery\". The two most regularly used sacraments are Baptism and Eucharist (communion). But most Christians use seven Sacraments: Baptism, Confirmation, the Eucharist, Holy Orders, Reconciliation of a Penitent (confession), Anointing of the Sick, and Marriage. Some Christian denominations prefer to call them \"ordinances\". Liturgical calendar. Roman Catholics, Anglicans, Eastern Christians, and traditional Protestant groups center their worship around a liturgical calendar. Some events that are part of this calendar are the holy days, such as solemnities which honor an event in the life of Jesus or the saints, times of fasting such as Lent, and other events, such as memoria. Christian groups that do not follow a liturgical tradition often keep some celebrations, such as Christmas, Easter and Pentecost. A few churches do not even use a liturgical calendar. Christian beliefs. Even though Christians have many differences of beliefs and opinions, they share some beliefs that they believe are very important to their faith. Creeds. Creeds (from Latin \"credo\" meaning \"I believe\") are direct doctrinal statements or confessions, usually of religious beliefs. They started as baptismal formulas and were later became larger during the Christological controversies of the 4th and 5th centuries to become statements of faith. Most Christians (Roman Catholics, Protestants, and so on) accept the use of creeds, and often use at least one of the creeds given above. A smaller number of Protestants, notably Restorationists, a movement formed in the wake of the Second Great Awakening in the 19th century of the 19th century United States, oppose the use of creeds. Jesus Christ. The most basic part of Christianity is the belief in Jesus as the Son of God and Messiah (Christ). The title \"Messiah\" comes from the Hebrew word \u05de\u05b8\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05d7\u05b7 (\"m\u0101\u0161i\u00e1\u0127\") meaning \"anointed one\". The Greek translation (\"Christos\") is the source of the English word \"Christ\". Christians believe that, as the Messiah, Jesus was anointed by God as ruler and savior of all people. Christians also believe that Jesus' coming was the fulfillment of messianic prophecies of the Old Testament. The Christian belief of the Messiah is much different than the contemporary Jewish concept. The main Christian belief is that, through the death and resurrection of Jesus, sinful humans can be reconciled to God. Though this, they believe they are given salvation and the promise of eternal life. There have been many theological disagreements over the nature of Jesus over the first centuries of Christian history. But Christians generally believe that Jesus is God incarnate and \"true God and true man.\" Jesus, having become fully human, suffered the pain and temptations of a mortal man, but he did not sin. As fully God, he defeated death and came back to life again. According to the Bible, \"God raised him from the dead,\" he ascended to heaven, is \"seated at the right hand of the Father\" and will return again to fulfill the rest of Messianic prophecy such as the Resurrection of the dead, the Last Judgment and the final creation of the Kingdom of God. From what the Gospels of Matthew and Luke say, Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born from the Virgin Mary. Only little of Jesus' childhood is written in the canonical Gospels, but infancy Gospels were popular in antiquity. But the time of Jesus' adulthood the week before his death are written much about in the Gospels. Some of the Biblical writings of of Jesus' ministry are: his baptism, miracles, preaching, teaching, and deeds. Death and resurrection of Jesus. Christians believe the the resurrection of Jesus to be the main part of their faith (see) and the most important event in human history, because it would show that that Jesus has power over death and have the authority to give people eternal life. Among Christian beliefs, the death and resurrection of Jesus are two main events of Christian doctrine and theology. From what the New Testament says, Jesus was crucified, died a physical death, was buried in a tomb, and came back from the dead three days later. The New Testament writes that several times Jesus appeared many times before his Twelve Apostles and disciples, and one time before \"more than five hundred brethren at once,\" before Jesus' Ascension to heaven. Jesus' death and resurrection are remember by Christians in their worship services, and most commonly during Holy Week, which has Good Friday and Easter Sunday in the week. Most every Christian church believe and teach the New Testament writing of the resurrection of Jesus. Some liberal Christians do not accept a that Jesus came back from the dead, as they believe it to be a good symbolic and spiritual myth. Arguments over the death and resurrection of Jesus are very common at many religious debates and interfaith dialogues. Paul the Apostle, an early Christian convert and missionary, wrote, \"If Christ was not raised, then all our preaching is useless, and your trust in God is useless.\" The Unitarian church is one of the few denominations where the resurrection of Jesus is not taught. Salvation. Protestantism teaches that eternal salvation is a gift that is given to a person by God's grace. It is sometimes called \"unmerited favor.\" This would mean that Salvation is God bringing humans into a right relationship with God through faith in Jesus Christ. It is the belief that one can be saved (rescued) from sin and forever death. Many Protestants believe in the \"assurance of salvation\"\u2014that God can put confidence in a believer that he has has truly received salvation from Jesus Christ. Catholicism teaches that in most cases someone must be a baptized a Catholic to be saved, it is sometimes possible for people to be saved who have not fully joined the Catholic Church. Catholics normally believe in the importance of works and sacraments in getting salvation. The Catholic Church teaches that faith is important, but it also believes that salvation also requires good works and piety, such as obedience to commands, taking the sacraments, going to church, doing penance and giving alms, saying prayers, and other things, to receive eternal life. The formal study of theology of salvation is Soteriology. Different denominations and traditions of Christianity believe in forms divine grace. Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy teach the complete importance of the free will to work together with grace. Reformed theology teaches the importance of grace by teaching that a person is completely incapable of self-redemption, but the grace of God overcomes even the unwilling heart. Arminianism believes in a synergistic view, while Lutheran and most other Protestant denominations teach justification by grace through faith alone. Trinity. Trinitarianism is the group of Christians who believe in the \"Trinity\". Almost all Christian denominations and Churches believe this. Nontrinitarianism is the beliefs systems that do not believe in the Trinity. Many different nontrinitarian views, such as adoptionism or modalism, existed in early Christianity, leading to the disputes about Christology. Scriptures. Christianity uses the Bible, many canonical books in two parts, the Old Testament and the New Testament. It is believed by Christians that they were written by people who were inspired by the Holy Spirit, and therefore it is most often believe to be the word of God. There is some differences in Bible versions and editions throughout Christianity. Afterlife and Eschaton. Most Christians believe that humans beings will receive judgement from God and are given either eternal life or eternal damnation. This includes the \"Last Judgment\" as well as the belief of a judgement particular to the soul after death. There are also some differences among Christians in this belief. For example, in Roman Catholicism, those who die in a state of grace, go into purgatory. Some churches who do not believe in particular judgment, for example Jehovahs Witnesses, believe that the soul sleeps. Christians believe that at the second coming of Christ at the end of time, all who have died will be resurrected from the dead for the Last Judgment, when Jesus will establish the Kingdom of God. There is also the belief of Universal Reconciliation. That is the belief that all people will someday receive salvation, rejecting the concept that hell is forever. Christians who believe in this view are known as Universalists. Types of Christianity. People who call themselves Christians may show or live their faith in different ways. They may also believe different things. Through history the three main groups or \"denominations\" of Christianity have been the Orthodox, the Catholic and the Protestant churches. Not all Christians use these titles. Some believe Christianity is bigger and includes others. Some believe Christianity is smaller and does not include all these churches. Disagreements. Some of these groups could not agree on certain points about Christian teaching (called \u201cdoctrine\u201d) or practice. The first split was in the 5th century after the Church Council of Ephesus. There council agreed Nestorianism was wrong; the Assyrian Church of the East did not agree and split from the rest. The argument was about the nature of Jesus. Should he be regarded as God and human in one combined nature, or in two separated natures? Most of the bishops, following the Pope (the Bishop of Rome), refused to stay in communion with any bishop who wouldn't say \"two separated natures\". This was also discussed at the Council of Chalcedon, about 50 years later. The Christians who did not agree with the decision of the Council to excommunicate them, became the Non-Chalcedonian Orthodox. The largest Non-Chalcedonian Churches are the Coptic Orthodox in Egypt, the Ethiopian Orthodox, the Armenian, and some Lebanese Orthodox Churches. In general, these churches are known as Oriental Orthodox Churches. Recent discussions between the Roman Catholic Pope John Paul II and the Coptic Orthodox Pope Shenouda III concluded that they believe many of the same things after all, even though the Coptic Church does not recognise the Pope of Rome as its leader. The third split happened in the 11th century. It is called the Great Schism. It was mostly based on personal disagreements between the Bishops of Rome and Constantinople. The disagreements were made worse because the two cultures often did not understand one another. Also many Crusaders from Western Europe behaved badly. The Christians in Western Europe were led by the Bishop of Rome, known also as the Pope. They are called the Catholic Church. Most Christians in Eastern Europe, Russia, and the Middle East belong to the Orthodox Churches, led by the Bishops of other cities or areas. In the 15th century the invention of the printing press made it easier for more people to read and study the Bible. This led many thinkers over the years to come up with new ideas and to break away from the Pope and his church. They started the Protestant or Reformed churches. Some Catholics and Orthodox do not consider Protestants to be fully Christian. The most important Protestant leaders were Martin Luther and John Calvin. Later some of these groups disagreed amongst themselves, so that these denominations split again into smaller groups. The main Protestant denominations today are the Baptist, Lutheran, and Calvinist Presbyterian Churches. In England, a similar protest against the Pope, first political and later religious, led to the Church of England which has bishops and officially calls itself Reformed Catholic but is often referred to as Protestant. The Anglican communion of churches includes several churches called \"Episcopal\" or \"Episcopalian\", because they have bishops. Some Anglican Churches have a style of worship that is closer to the Protestant services, others worship more like Catholics, but none of them accept the Pope, or are accepted by him. In general, the Protestant denominations differ from the Catholic and Orthodox Churches in having given up some of the traditional sacraments, having no ordained priesthood, and not having the same fondness for Mary, the mother of Jesus, that the Catholic and Orthodox churches have. Other differences. Protestants differ from Catholic and Orthodox Christians in placing more importance on a person\u2019s experience of first choosing to follow Jesus. Catholic and Orthodox Christians think that the ongoing growth in holiness that should take place over a person's lifetime is more important. Most Christian worship has Scripture reading, talk about Scripture from a leader, singing, prayer together, and a small time for church work such as collecting money. Christians may meet in special buildings, also called churches, or outdoors, or at schools, or anywhere Christians feel they are needed. The main worship service in Catholic Churches is the Mass and the main worship service in many Orthodox Churches is called the Divine Liturgy. In both of these Churches, along with the other parts of worship, the Eucharist or Communion is central. Here a priest by prayer asks God to change a small amount of bread and wine into what Catholics and Orthodox believe is Jesus's real body and blood, but without changing the accidents (appearance, taste, colour, etc.) of the bread and wine. Then the people each may receive a portion. Many Protestant churches have ceremonies more or less similar to the Mass, some every week, others a few times a year. Some Protestants believe Jesus is really present at the Communion service, and some believe the bread and wine are symbols to help them remember what Jesus did. Other Protestant churches do not have Communion at all. Catholics have developed a short ceremony, Eucharistic Benediction, worshipping Jesus present in the Eucharist. They also may visit a church building to pray in the presence of the Eucharist, Eucharistic Adoration. Orthodox and Catholic spirituality place importance on the use of human senses such as sight and on the use of beautiful things. Catholic spirituality often involves the use of statues and other artistic representations, candles, incense, and other physical items as reminders or aids to prayer. The Orthodox Churches also use candles, incense, bells, and icons, but not statues. Orthodox and Catholic worship also involves use of gestures, such as the Sign of the Cross, made by each person touching first the forehead, then chest, one shoulder, then the other shoulder. There is also bowing, kneeling, and prostration in Catholic and Orthodox worship. Groups outside the three big groups of denominations. There are other denominations that do not fit into the three largest categories. While some of these groups see themselves as Christian, many of the other Christian groups do not agree that they are. All of these groups began after 1800 AD. Most of them do not believe Jesus is God, or do not believe in the Trinity, or for other reasons do not believe what other Christians believe. One denomination which is Protestant (but has some beliefs that are different from most Protestant denominations) is the Seventh-day Adventist Church. History. Christianity has large history from the time of Jesus and his apostles to the present time. Christianity began in the 1st century AD as a Jewish sect but quickly spread throughout the Greco-Roman world. Although it was originally persecuted under the Roman Empire, it became the state religion in the end. In the Middle Ages it spread into Northern Europe and Russia. During the Age of Exploration, Christianity expanded throughout the world, and is now the largest religion of the world. The religion had schisms and theological disputes that had as result three main branches: the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox churches, and Protestant churches. Demographics. With an estimated number of Christians being somewhere around 1.5 billion to 2.1 billion, split into around 34,000 different denominations, Christianity is the world's largest religion. The Christian share of the world's population has been around 33% for the last hundred years. This has caused Christianity to spread throughout the world, mainly in Europe and North America. It is still the main religion of Europe, the Americas, the Philippines, and Southern Africa. However it is becoming smaller in some areas, some of them are; Oceania (Australia and New Zealand), Northern Europe (with Great Britain, Scandinavia and other places), France, Germany, the Canadian provinces of Ontario, British Columbia, and Quebec, the Western and Northern parts of the United States, and parts of Asia (especially the Middle East, South Korea, Taiwan and Macau). In most countries in the developed world, the number of people going to church who claim to be Christians has been dropping over the last few decades. Some believe that this is only because many no longer use regular membership in places, for example churches, while others believe it is because people may be thinking that religion is no longer important. Ecumenism. Most churches have for a long time showed that they want to be tolerant with other belief systems, and in the 20th century Christian ecumenism advanced in two ways. One way was more cooperation between groups, such as the Edinburgh Missionary Conference of Protestants in 1910, the Justice, Peace and Creation Commission of the World Council of Churches started in 1948 by Protestant and Orthodox churches, and similar national councils, for example the National Council of Churches in Australia with Roman Catholics. The other way was creating unions for different churches to join together. Congregationalist, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches joined together in 1925 to form the United Church of Canada, and in 1977 to form the Uniting Church in Australia. The Church of South India was formed in 1947 by the union of Anglican, Methodist, Congregationalist, Presbyterian, and Reformed churches. And other such formations have been done by different Christian groups throughout the years.",
   "Saarbr\u00fccken": "Saarbr\u00fccken (French Sarrebruck) is a German city and a district in the state of Saarland. It is also the capital of the Saarland. Saarbr\u00fccken has 180,000 inhabitants and is on the river Saar.",
   "Russian language": "Russian (Russian: \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a, transliteration: \"russkiy yaz'ik\") is an East Slavic language. This language is a part of the Indo-European language family. Russian is the most widely spoken of the Slavic languages. Russian is the official language of Russia, and also an official language of Belarus, Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. Russian is one of the six official languages of the United Nations. Naming. In Russian-speaking countries, people are supposed to name their children after their father. One of the most famous Russian names is Anastasia. Girls' middle names are their fathers name plus a feminine ending of either \"evna\" or \"ovna.\" Boys have their father's name as well, with a masculine ending added of either \"evich\" or \"ovich.\" Girls' have their father's last name, and most of the time to make it feminine they add an \"a\" to their father's last name. Boys also carry their fathers name, no ending is added.",
   "California": "California (\"The Golden State\") is a large state in the western United States. It has more people than any other US state (more than 33 million people). Its most famous cities are Los Angeles (Hollywood, famed world-wide for movie-making, is a district within Los Angeles) and San Francisco. The capital is Sacramento. Culture. The current governor of California is Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has gained fame as a popular actor. Before his acting career, he was a bodybuilder. He was the actor who acted as the terminator in the terminator movie series. There are two senators: Barbara Boxer, and Dianne Feinstein. The state is a leader in three businesses: farming, movie-making, and high technology, namely software and Web sites. It is near a transformant boundary (also known as a fault line) which means a lot of earthquakes happen. People in California have to be prepared for earthquakes. It has more people than any other state in the United States. If California were a country it would have the sixth largest total production in the world, more than many other countries put together. California is probably the state with the most different kinds of people and types of land \u2014 mountains, deserts, coasts \u2014 than any other state in America. It is often called \"The Golden State\", possibly because of the Gold Rush back in 1849. Also, however, the grasses become golden during the summertime. The post office uses \"CA\" to mark California and the Associated Press uses \"Calif.\" or \"Cali.\" Economy. California is a major power in American culture as well as the business life of the nation. Many of the great changes in technology and law come from California, and the state pays more to the U.S. government than it gets back. It also has some of the country's largest cities, such as Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, and San Francisco. History. In the past, the whole area we now call \"California\" was not just today's California, but also covered the Mexican lands south of it, as well as Nevada, Utah, and parts of Arizona and Wyoming. The Spaniards called the part of the territory that eventually became part of the United States \"Alta California\" (Upper California) when it was split from what became \"Baja California\" (Lower California). In these early times, the borders of the Sea of Cortez and the Pacific coast were not well known, so the old maps wrongly showed California to be an island. The name comes from \"Las sergas de Espladi\u00e1n\" (Adventures of Spladian), a 16th century book by Garci Rodr\u00edguez de Montalvo, where there is an island paradise called California. The first European who visited parts of the coast, Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, came from Portugal in 1542, just fifty years after Christopher Columbus made his first trip. The first European who saw the entire coast was Sir Francis Drake, in 1579, and he decided that the British owned it. But starting in the late 1700s, Spanish religious leaders of the Roman Catholic Church (\"missionaries\") got large gifts of land in the area north of Baja California, from the Spanish king and queen. These religious people set up small towns and villages, the famous California Missions. When Mexico was no longer controlled by Spain, the Mexican government took over the villages, and they soon emptied out. In 1846, as the Mexican-American War was starting, some Americans in California hoped to create a California Republic. These men flew a \"Bear flag\" that had a golden bear with a star on it. This Republic ended suddenly, however, when Commodore John D. Sloat of the United States Navy sailed into San Francisco Bay. He said that California was now part of the United States. After the war with Mexico ended, California was split between the two countries. The Mexican portion became the Mexican states of Baja California Norte (north) and Baja California Sur (south). (\"Baja\" means \"lower\" in Spanish.) The western part of the part given to the United States became today's state of California. In 1848, there were about 4,000 Spanish-speaking people in today's California on the American side. (Today the state has a total of nearly 40,000,000 people.) In 1849, gold was suddenly found and the number of people went up very fast as the Gold Rush took hold. In 1850, California became a state in the Union (the United States). During the American Civil War (1861-1865), about 70% of the people in California believed that the South was right, and only 30% were for the North. But California joined the war effort on the side of the North (the Union) and sent many troops east to fight the Confederacy. At first, travel between the far west and the east coast of the United States was dangerous and took a lot of time. Going by land was very difficult, because there were no roads and no trains, and many Native Americans were attacking American settlers heading West in wagons. The only other way was to travel by boat around the Cape of Good Hope, at the southern end of South America. This took months, since the trip was thousands of miles long and the Panama Canal had not yet been built either. But in 1869, the connection got better quickly, because the first railroad across the continent was finished. Meanwhile, more people in California were learning that the land there was very good to grow fruit and other crops. Oranges were grown in many parts of California. This was the beginning of the huge farming business that California has today. California today. In 1900, there were still \"only\" a million people in California; Los Angeles \u2014 which today has more than 3,000,000 and another 12,000,000 around it \u2014 had only 100,000. Today, California has more people than any other U.S. state. It is the only state that has more people than the country of Venezuela. Starting in 1965, the variety of people became much greater as many different people from around the world came to the United States and often decided to live in California. Many, but by no means all, of the people in California tend to be liberal. Technology is very advanced and many new cultural trends begin there. Engineering and computers play a big part in the state's life. For over a hundred years, film has been one of the most important businesses in California. By the 1950s, television had also become an important business in California.",
   "Propaganda": "Propaganda is information. This information has been designed to make people feel a certain way or to believe a certain thing. The information is usually political. It is hard to tell whether the information is true or false. Very often, the information is confusing and unfair. The word 'propaganda' comes from Latin. At first, it meant 'ideas to be spread around'. But in First World War, it came to mean 'political ideas that are supposed to be misleading'. Propaganda is like advertising in some ways. But advertising is usually trying to sell something and propaganda is usually political and used by states or political parties, not private companies. Propaganda is often used during wars. There it can be very useful. It can take the form of posters, TV advertisements, and radio announcements. Sometimes it keeps the people of a country happy - telling them that their country is fighting well and telling them how important it is that the enemy is defeated. Sometimes it tries to make people hate the enemy. The information could tell people that the enemy is evil or make them seem not human. Sometimes a government gives propaganda to the enemy - telling them that the war is going badly for them and that they should stop fighting. When a country is not at war, propaganda can still be used. The government may use propaganda to change what people think about a political situation. A group may try to change the way people act towards an issue. Propaganda under some countries, like dictatorships, is used along with censorship. While propaganda tries to give people false ideas, censorship forces the ones who disagree with propaganda to keep quiet. Then the propaganda can say everything, because nobody can question it in public. Propaganda is also used to win people by tricking them. Some people say that cults use propaganda to get people to join them.",
   "Drunk driving": "Drunk driving (Drink driving in the UK and Australia) is the act of driving a motor vehicle (car, truck, etc.) while under the effects of alcohol. Drunk driving is illegal in most areas of the world. In some places, driving a motorless vehicle such as a bicycle while drunk is also illegal. Most \"areas that make laws\" (\"jurisdictions\") started with DWI (driving while intoxicated) laws, banning just alcohol. Later, most changed them to DUI (driving under the influence) laws, adding other drugs to those banned while driving. The most common blood alcohol content (BAC) limit in the United States is 0.08% for the legal meaning of drunk. Only three states still use the more lax, original standard of 0.10%. Many jurisdictions add extra penalties (more jail time and/or a longer DUI program) in cases where the driver's BAC is over 0.20%. History of drunk driving laws. The first jurisdiction in the United States to adopt laws against drunk driving was the state of New York in 1910, with California (1911) and others doing the same later. Early laws simply banned driving while drunk, with no mention of what BAC was banned.The state of Georgia was one of the last states to adopt laws against drunk driving.One of the worst years in alcohol related crashes was 1982.The year 1982 had 26,173 alcohol related deaths due to drunk driving. In the US, most of the laws were greatly tightened in the early 1980s, largely due to pressure from groups like Mothers Against Drunk Drivers (MADD) and.",
   "Leg": "A leg is something used to support things; to hold them up. Birds and humans have two legs. Some objects, for example tables and chairs, also have legs to hold them up. Animals normally have 2 or 4 legs (vertebrates, which are animals with a backbone), or 6, 8, or 12 (arthropods, for example insects and spiders). Centipedes and millipedes have a lot more legs, but not exactly a hundred or a thousand as their names make people who do not know them think. Humans have 2 legs, complete with feet. \"Biped\" is an animal with two legs and \"quadruped\" is an animal with four legs.",
   "Industry": "Industry includes all forms of economic activity. It can be divided into four sectors according to the nature of the activity. Primary industry extracts natural materials and provides raw materials for secondary industry. Secondary industry processes raw materials or semi-finished goods into more valuable products. Tertiary industry is the provision of services. Quaternary industry is the activity related to the application, manipulation and transmission of information. In a narrow sense, industry is confined to manufacturing activities.",

   "Poland": "Poland (Polish: \"Polska\") is officially called the Republic of Poland (Polish: \"Rzeczpospolita Polska\"). bordered by Germany to the west (along Oder and Lusatian Neisse), the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south, Ukraine and Belarus to the east, and the Baltic Sea, Lithuania, and Russia (in the form of the Kaliningrad Oblast exclave) to the north. It also shares a water border with Denmark and Sweden in the Baltic Sea. The total land area of Poland is about 312,679 km2 (120,728 mi2). This makes Poland the 77th largest country in the world with population over 38.5 million people. The Poles live mainly in large cities, including the capital, Warsaw (Polish: \"Warszawa\"), \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, the second capital of Poland (first was Gniezno), Cracow (Polish: \"Krak\u00f3w\"), Katowice, Gda\u0144sk and Pozna\u0144. The first time Poland was recorded in official papers was in 966. In 1569, Poland formed a long lasting union with Lithuania called the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Commonwealth collapsed in 1795 and the Poles were without a country for 123 years. Poland regained its independence in 1918 after World War I but lost it again in World War II. Several years later, Poland became a communist country within the Eastern Bloc under control of the former Soviet Union. In 1989, Poland stopped being a communist country and became a liberal democracy. Since May 1, 2004, Poland is the 6th most populated member state of the European Union. Poland is also a member of NATO, the United Nations, and the World Trade Organization. Before Piasts. The first sign of human population in Polish land is from 500.000 years ago. The Bronze Age started around 2400-2300 BC. The Iron Age started around 750-700 BC. Then on Polish lands there was Lusatian culture. About year 400 BC there lived Celtic and Germanic tribes. Those people had trade contacts with Roman Empire. With time, Slavscame to Polish lands. The part of those Slavs, later called \"western\", stayed there to today and started to create new countries. The most powerful was country of Polans and country of Vistulans. At last, Polish country and nation was created under Polans rule. Piast and Jegiellon dynasties. Poland began to form into a country around the middle of the 10th century in the Piast dynasty. In 966, Prince Mieszko I got himself and the whole Polish nation Christianized. Next ruler was Boles\u0142aw I of Poland (called Brave). He conquered many lands and he became first King of Poland. Casimir I of Poland called Restorer (rebuilder) moved Polish capitol from robbed by Bohemians Gniezno to Krak\u00f3w. In the 12th century Poland broke into some smaller states after the death of King Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth in 1138 because of his testament. Those states were later attacked by Mongol armies in 1241, what slowed action to unite of Poland. In 1320 W\u0142adys\u0142aw I became the King of the united Poland. His son Casimir III the Great repaired the Polish economy, built new castles and won the war against the Ruthenian Dukedom. In addition, Poland became a haven for emigrating people. A large number of Jewish people also moved into Poland during that time. The Black Death, which affected many parts of Europe from 1347 to 1351, did not come to Poland. After death of last Piast on Polish throne, Casimir III, Louis I of Hungary and his daughter Jadwiga of Polandstarted to rule. She got married with Lithuanian prince Jogaila. That event started a new dynasty in Polish throne: Jagiellon dynasty. Under the Jagiellon dynasty, Poland made an alliance with its neighbour Lithuania. Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth to II Republic of Poland. In the 17th century Sweden attacked almost all of Poland (this was called \u201cthe Deluge\u201d). Many wars against the Ottoman Empire, Russia, Cossacks, Transylvania and Brandenburg-Prussia ended in 1699. During the following 80 years, the government and nationed were weaker, making Poland dependent on Russia. Russian tsars took advantage of this by offering money to traitors, who would block new ideas and solutions. Russia, Prussia, and Austria broke Poland into three pieces in 1772, 1793 and 1795, which dissolved the country. Before second broke, in 1791 was made Constitution called \"Constitution of 3 May\". Polish people did not like the new kings, and often rebelled (two big rebels in 1830 and 1863). Napoleon made another Polish state, \u201cthe Duchy of Warsaw\u201d, but after the Napoleonic wars, Poland was split again by the countries at the Congress of Vienna. The eastern part was ruled by the Russian tsar. During World War I all the Allies agreed to save Poland. Soon after the surrender of Germany in November 1918, Poland became the Second Polish Republic (\"II Rzeczpospolita Polska\"). It got its freedom after several military conflicts; the largest was in 1919-1921 Polish-Soviet War. World War II. On September 1, 1939, World War II started when Nazi Germany attacked Poland, and the Soviet Union attacked on September 17. Warsaw was defeated on September 28, and Poland was split up into two pieces, one half owned by Nazi Germany, the other by the Soviet Union (border like between Poland and Soviet Union after 1945, but not the same). The eastern part of the German zone was turned into the German Government area. Out of all the countries that were in the war, Poland lost the highest amount of its people, in which more than 6 million died, including half of them which were Polish Jews. Most of the deaths were related to the Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews including other people were killed. Poland also gave the most troops, after the US, the British and the Soviets, to ultimately defeat Nazi Germany. At the war's end, Poland's borders were moved west, pushing the east border to the Curzon line. The west border was moved to the Oder-Neisse line. The new Poland became 20% smaller by 77,500 square kilometeres (29,900 sq mi). The shift forced millions of Poles, Germans, Ukrainians, and Jews to move. Post-war. After these events Poland became a communist country under the Soviet Union rule. It was from then on, called People's Republic of Poland. There are still many Polish in the neighbouring countries Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania (those countries was then part of Soviet Union), as well as in other countries. The most Poles outside of Poland are in the United States, especially in Chicago. In 1989 Solidarity - a trade union led by Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa - helped defeat the communist government in Poland. After that event, Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa got Noble Prize. During the early 1990s the country turned its economy into one of the most solid in Central Europe. There were many improvements in human rights, such as freedom of speech, democracy, etc. In 1991 Poland became a member of the Visegrad Group and joined NATO in 1999 also with the Czech Republic and Hungary. Polish voters then voted to join the European Union in a vote in June 2003. The country joined the EU on May 1, 2004. Geography. Poland\u2019s territory covers across five geographical regions. In the northwest is the Baltic seacoast, which starts from the Bay of Pomerania, and ends at the Gulf of Gdansk. This coast is marked by several spits, coastal lakes (former bays that have been cut off from the sea), and dunes. The largely straight coastline is curved inwards by the Szczecin Lagoon, the Bay of Puck, and the Vistula Lagoon. The center and parts of the north lie inside the Northern European Lowlands. Rising gently above these lowlands is a geographical region making up the four hilly districts of moraines and moraine-dammed lakes that formed during and after the Pleistocene ice age. These lake districts are the Pomeranian Lake District, the Greater Polish Lake District, the Kashubian Lake District, and the Masurian Lake District. The Masurian Lake District is the largest of the four and covers much of northeastern Poland. The lake districts form part of the Baltic Ridge, a series of moraine belts along the southern shore of the Baltic Sea. South of the Northern European Lowlands lie the regions of Silesia and Masovia, which are marked by broad ice-age river valleys. Farther south lies the Polish mountain region, including the Sudetes, the Cracow-Cz\u0119stochowa Upland, the \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Mountains, and the Carpathian Mountains, including the Beskids. The highest part of the Carpathians is the Tatra Mountains, along Poland\u2019s southern border. The major historical regions of Poland include Pomerania, Greater Poland, Silesia, Lesser Poland, Masovia, Warmia, Masuria, and Podlachia. Urban demographics. The lists below show the population count of Poland's largest cities based on 2005 estimates. Voivodeships. Poland is made of sixteen regions known as voivodeships (\"wojew\u00f3dztwa\", singular - \"wojew\u00f3dztwo\"). They are basically created from the country's historical regions, whereas those of the past two decades (till 1998) had been focused on and named for separate cities. The new units range in areas from under 10,000 km\u00b2 (Opole Voivodeship) to over 35,000 km\u00b2 (Masovian Voivodeship). Voivodeships are controlled by voivod governments, and their legislatures are called voivodeship sejmiks. The sixteen voivodeships that make up Poland are further divided into \"powiaty\" (singular \"powiat\"), second-level units of administration, which are about the same as to a county, district or prefecture in other countries. People. In the past, Poland was inhabited by people from different nations and of different religions (mainly Catholics, Orthodox and Judaism). This changed after 1939, because of the Nazi Holocaust which killed many Polish Jews. After World War II, the country was changed into a communist country, by the Warsaw Pact which included most eastern European countries, including Russia. Today 36,983,700 people, or 96.74% of the population call themselves Polish (Census 2002), while 471,500 people (1.23%)claimed another nationality. 774,900 people (2.03%) didn't declare any nationality. Nathionalites or an ethnic groups in Poland are Silesians, Germans (most in the former Opole Voivodeship), Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Russians, Jews and Belarusians. The Polish language is part of the West Slavic section of the Slavic languages. It is also the official language of Poland. English and German are the most common second languages studied and spoken. In the past few years, Poland's population has gone down because of an increase in emigration and a sharp drop in the birth rate. In 2006, the census office estimated the total population of Poland at 38,536,869, a very small rise on the 2002 figure of 38,230,080. Since Poland's accession to the European Union, a large number of Polish people have moved to work in Western European countries like the United Kingdom and Ireland. Some organizations state people have left because of high unemployment (10.5%) and better opportunities for work somewhere else. In April 2007, the Polish population of the United Kingdom had risen to about 300,000 people and estimates predict about 65,000 Polish people living in Ireland. However, in recent years strong growth of Polish economy and increasing value of Polish currency (PLN) makes many Polish immigrants to go back home. In 2007 number of people leaving the country was lower than people who are coming back. Poland become attractive place to work for people from other countries (mainly Ukraine). A Polish minority is still present in neighboring countries of Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania, as well as in other countries. The largest number of ethnic Poles outside of the country can be found in the United States.",
   "Wales": "Wales (Welsh: Cymru) is a state of United Kingdom. It is one of the five Celtic states (Republic of Ireland, which is also Celtic, is a country) and it is part of the former. Wales is to the west side of England. The capital of Wales is Cardiff (in Welsh: \"Caerdydd\"), which has 325,000 people. The National Assembly of Wales is in Cardiff. The highest mountains in Wales are in Gwynedd, in the north-west, and include Snowdon \"(or Yr Wyddfa)\", which is the highest peak in Wales at 1085 m (3,560 ft). Wales has a population of just under three million people. The majority of the population lives in the South and the East of the country. The main languages spoken in Wales are English and Welsh. Welsh is a Celtic language, related to Cornish and Breton. About one out of every five people in Wales speaks it.",
   "Scotland": "Scotland (Scottish Gaelic: \"Alba\") is a state of UK. It is on the north of island Great Britain. Scotland shares a state border with England. The state is also bordered by the North Sea to the east, the Atlantic Ocean to the west and also the Irish Sea. Scotland was once an independent country with its own government but is now one of the four states that form United Kingdom. In 1603 the King of Scotland James VI of Scotland became King of England too. In 1707 the parliament of Scotland joined with the parliament of England to become the parliament of Great Britain, and in 1801 Great Britain joined with Ireland to become United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Even though Scotland is not independent, throughout history it always had a separate, law and school system and a unique culture. Since 1999 Scotland has had its own parliament. However, many things are still controlled by the Westminster parliament in London, England. Some people in Scotland now want independence again for their state and it to become a country. The Scottish flag is blue with a white diagonal cross (called a saltire). This is the cross of Saint Andrew, who is the patron saint of Scotland. Some other symbols used for Scotland are a thistle, and a lion. The north of Scotland has many mountains, and few people live there. Most people live in the low central area, or around the coast. South of the central belt are the Southern Uplands, another hilly place. On the west coast and in the north are a lot of islands. The capital city of Scotland is the city of Edinburgh, on the east coast. But the biggest city is Glasgow - nearly half of Scotland's people live in Glasgow or in the area near it. Other cities in Scotland are Aberdeen, Dundee, Inverness and Stirling. Geography. The main part of Scotland makes up one-third of the size of the British Isles, and is located to the northwest of Europe. The size of the land of Scotland is 78,772km\u00b2 (30,414 sq mi). Scotland's only land border is with England, and runs for 96 kilometres (60 mi). The Atlantic Ocean borders the west coast and the North Sea is to the east. The island of Ireland is only 30 kilometres (20 mi) from the southern part of Kintyre; Norway is 305 kilometers (190 mi) to the east and the Faroes, 270 kilometres (168 mi) to the north. Scotland's highest point is the top of Ben Nevis, in Lochaber, while Scotland's longest river, the River Tay, flows for a distance of 190 km (120 miles). History. The history of Scotland begins around 10,000 years ago, when humans first began to inhabit Scotland after the end of the last ice age. Of the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age civilization that existed in the country, many artifacts remain, but few written records were left behind. The written history of Scotland mostly begins with the arrival of the Roman Empire in Britain, when the Romans occupied what is now England and Wales, taking it as a Roman region called Britannia. To the north was land not owned by the Romans \u2014 Caledonia, by name. Its people were the Picts. From a historical view Scotland seemed to be slow to advance, gathering knowledge from the Mediterranean countries, but as knowledge of the past increases it is now known that some areas were earlier and more advanced than previously thought, and that the sea was very important to Scottish history. Because of the geographical location of Scotland and its strong reliance on trade routes by sea, the nation held close links in the south and east with the Baltic countries, and through Ireland with France and Europe. Following the Acts of Union and Industrial Revolution, Scotland grew to be one of the largest commercial, intellectual and industrial states in Europe. Independence. The Wars of Scottish Independence were a series of military campaigns fought between Scotland and England in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. The First War (1296\u20131328) began with the English invasion of Scotland in 1296, and ended with the signing of the Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton in 1328. The Second War (1332\u20131357) began with the English-supported invasion of Edward Balliol and the 'Disinherited' in 1332, and ended around 1357 with the signing of the Treaty of Berwick. The wars were part of a great national crisis for Scotland and the period became one of the most important moments in the nation's history. At the end of both wars, Scotland still was a free and independent country, which was her main aim throughout the conflict. The wars were also important for other reasons, such as the emergence of the longbow as a key weapon in medieval warfare. A series of deaths in the line of succession in the 1280s, followed by King Alexander III's death in 1286 left the Scottish crown in disarray. His granddaughter Margaret, the \"Maid of Norway\", a four-year old girl, was the heir. Edward I of England, as Margaret's great-uncle, suggested that his son (also a child) and Margaret should marry, stabilising the Scottish line of succession. In 1290 Margaret's guardians agreed to this, but Margaret herself died in Orkney on her voyage from Norway to Scotland before she was made Queen or her marriage could take place. John Balliol, the man with the strongest claim to the throne, became king (30 November 1292). Robert Bruce of Annandale, the next strongest claimant, accepted this outcome (his grandson and namesake later took the throne as Robert I). Over the next few years Edward I attempted to undermine both the authority of King John and the independence of Scotland. In 1295 John, on the recommendation of his chief councillors, entered into an alliance with France. This was the beginning of the Auld Alliance. In 1296 Edward invaded Scotland, removing King John. The following year William Wallace and Andrew de Moray raised an army from the southern and northern parts of the country to resist the occupation. Under their joint leadership an English army was defeated at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. For a short time Wallace ruled Scotland in the name of John Balliol as Guardian of the realm. Edward came north in person and defeated Wallace at the Battle of Falkirk (1298). Wallace escaped but resigned as Guardian of Scotland. John Comyn and Robert the Bruce were put in his place. In 1305 Wallace was captured by the English, who executed him for treason. Wallace claimed he did not commit treason as he owed no allegiance to England. In February 1306 Robert Bruce murdered John Comyn, a leading rival. Bruce went on to take the crown, but Edward's army overran the country after defeating Bruce's small army at the Battle of Methven. Despite the excommunication of Bruce and his followers by Pope Clement V his support slowly strengthened; and by 1314 with the help of leading nobles such as Sir James Douglas and the Earl of Moray only the castles at Bothwell and Stirling were still under English control. Edward I had died in 1307. His heir Edward II moved an army north to break the siege of Stirling Castle and again take control. Robert defeated that army at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, securing temporary independence. In 1320 a letter to the Pope from the nobles of Scotland (the Declaration of Arbroath) went part of the way towards convincing Pope John XXII to overturn the earlier excommunication and cancel the various acts of submission by Scottish kings to English ones so that Scotland's independence could be recognised by other European countries. In 1326, the first full Parliament of Scotland met. The parliament had evolved from an earlier council of nobility and clergy around 1235, but in 1326 representatives of the burghs \u2014 the burgh commissioners \u2014 joined them to form the Three Estates. In 1328, Edward III signed the Treaty of Northampton declaring Scottish independence under the rule of Robert the Bruce. Four years after Robert's death in 1329, however, England once more invaded, looking to put the \"Rightful King\" \u2014 Edward Balliol, son of John Balliol \u2014 to the Scottish throne, starting the Second War of Independence. In the face of tough Scottish resistance, led by Sir Andrew Murray, attempts to secure Balliol on the throne failed. Edward III lost interest in Balliol after the outbreak of the Hundred Years' War with France. In 1341 David II, King Robert's son and heir, was able to return from temporary exile in France. Balliol finally resigned his vacant claim to the throne to Edward in 1356, before retiring to Yorkshire, where he died in 1364. Language. The official languages of Scotland are English and Gaelic. English is spoken by most people in Scotland, with only a small number, mostly in the Western Isles, speaking Gaelic. There is also another language called Scots, which is a Germanic language which is closely related to English. Football. Football is the most popular sport in Scotland. The big cities, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee, all have two or three big football teams, and most towns have at least one team. The two most famous teams in Scotland are known as the \"Old Firm\", Celtic and Rangers. These two Glasgow clubs have a lot of history, and are fierce rivals, often causing fights and even riots between the fans. Rangers are world record holders, having won the most amount of league titles of any football team, currently 51. Other football clubs. The other main clubs in Scotland are Aberdeen FC, Heart of Midlothian FC, Hibernian FC and Dundee United FC. These teams are normally in the Premier League and usually take the most places in the top six of the league. Some other Scottish clubs include Gretna FC, who won three titles in a row, moving from the Third Division, to the SPL in only three seasons, and also Raith Rovers FC, who famously played UEFA Cup Winners, Bayern Munich. Raith Rovers were knocked out by Bayern, but managed to lead them 1-0 at half time. Scottish Premier League. The top division of Scottish Football is called the \"Scottish Premier League\" (or SPL), and is currently sponsored by the Clydesdale Bank, a large Scottish Bank. Golf. Golf is also a popular sport in Scotland. Colin Montgomery, a professional golfer, is known as one of the best players never to have won a major championship after finishing second five times. Motorsports. Scotland is also involved with motorsports. Current F1 driver David Coulthard is a thirteen time Grand Prix winner. Jackie Stewart is a 3-time F1 World Champion and regarded as one of the best drivers ever. Jim Clark is a 2-time F1 World Champion and regarded as one of the three best ever with Schumacher and Senna. Colin McRae was also 1995 World Rally Champion. Elephant Polo. Scotland was the world champions of the unusual sport of Elephant Polo in 2004. Elephant Polo is registered as an Olympic sport with the Nepal Olympic Committee, and was invented by Scotsman James Manclark in 1983.",
   "Northern Ireland": "Northern Ireland (\"Tuaisceart \u00c9ireann\" in Irish or \"Norlin Airlann\" in Ulster Scots) is a state of United Kingdom and under the south of Ireland's jurisdiction as per the GFA. It is part of an island in Western Europe called Ireland that it shares with the Republic of Ireland. 1.7 million people live in Northern Ireland. The capital is Belfast. People. Northern Ireland has had many conflicts between some of the people who live there. Unionists, who are mostly Protestant, want the Northern Ireland to stay part of the United Kingdom. Nationalists, who are mostly Catholics, want the north of Ireland to leave the United Kingdom and have the whole island united as one country. Some people do not want to join the Republic of Ireland or remain part of the U.K. Instead, they want Northern Ireland to be an independent country. The population is made up of 52% Unionists and 48% Nationalists at the moment. Sometimes people use other names for Northern Ireland. Unionists sometimes call it \"Ulster\" but this is not correct as three counties of Ulster are in the Republic of Ireland. Nationalists sometimes call it \"the north\" or \"the six counties\" which is to state that it is part of a united Ireland, not the United Kingdom. There is no correct defining term for this part of Ireland. Languages. English is spoken by almost everyone in Northern Ireland. Another important language is Irish (sometimes called \"Irish Gaelic\" or \"Gaelic\") and a dialectual language known as Ulster Scots which comes from Eastern Ulster and Lowland Scotland. The Irish language, backed by Foras na Gaeilge, is widespread, especially in Belfast, the Glens of Antrim and counties Tyrone and Fermanagh. The Irish language is spoken by a large majority of nationalist (Catholic and Protestant) people. Ulster Scots is almost exclusive to areas of Belfast and mid Antrim. Some languages like Chinese, Urdu or Polish are becoming more common in Northern Ireland as people from other countries move to Northern Ireland. Belfast Agreement. Since the \"Belfast Agreement\", (sometimes called the \"Good Friday Agreement\") of Friday, 10 April 1998, there has been mainly peace between the two sides of the community. This agreement was agreed by most of the people in the North and the South Republic of Ireland, as well as the Irish and British government. It allows for self-government and for co convernance between the South and Britain and makes clear the right of the people of Northern Ireland to decide their future.",
   "Great Britain": "Great Britain is part of the United Kingdom. In geography, Great Britain is an island in Europe. It is the main part of the United Kingdom. It contains England, Scotland and Wales. England is the biggest part of the island. England is in the southeast. Wales is to the west of England. Scotland is to the north of England.

Northern Ireland is not a part of the island of Great Britain, but it's a part of the United Kingdom. The capital of England is London. Scotland's capital is Edinburgh and Wales' is Cardiff. Britain was called Great Britain originally to distinguish the island from Brittany. Thousands of people from Great Britain had gone to live in Brittany in the seventh and eighth centuries. History. Britain was made in the year 1707 when England and Scotland joined up because they already had the same king. This was called \"The Kingdom of Great Britain\". In the year 1800, Ireland joined up with Great Britain and they all were then called \"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\".

   "Derby County F.C.": "Derby County Football Club is an English football club. The club plays in the FA Premier League (also known as the Premiership) Early years. The club was formed in 1884 by players from Derbyshire County Cricket Club who wanted something to do in the winter. They started out by playing at the Racecourse Ground, Derby. The Rams, as Derby County are known, were one of the first members of The Football League when it started in 1888. Back in 1895 the club moved to a new stadium, The Baseball Ground. It was called this because baseball had been played there much earlier beforehand, and it became their home for the next 102 years. When they moved, Derby County had changed their club colours to the black and white they still use today at matches. In 1898, Derby got to their first FA Cup final, but lost. The same happened again in 1899 and 1903. Derby's went down to the Football League's Second Division for the first time in 1907, but they came back up to the First Division in 1911. In 1914 they were relegated again, but won the Second Division the next year to get promoted. World War I meant that they had to wait until 1919 to play First Division football again. After just two seasons, they were relegated yet again in 1921. After Derby's next promotion in 1926 the club got much better, and were one of the top teams from the late 1920s all the way through to the 1939-1940 season, which was interrupted when World War II broke out. FA Cup win. The FA Cup restarted in the 1945-1946 season. Derby got to the final again, but this time they beat Charlton Athletic 4-1 to win the Cup. Some people had thought the reason Derby kept losing in the FA Cup was that they were cursed by gypsies, as the Baseball Ground was built on the site of a gypsy camp. Some players even thought so, and before the final they asked the gypsies to lift the curse. The Football League began again the next season, but Derby didn't play well and were relegated in 1953. Things went from bad to worse and in 1955 they were relegated to the Football League Third Division (North) for the first time in their history. Derby were too good for that league though, and finished second at the first try. Then they did even better next season by finishing first, and going back up to the top division. The Clough years. In 1967, Brian Clough took over Derby County with Peter Taylor helping him. Derby were back in Division Two, but Clough got them promoted to the First Division in 1969. He led them to their first ever Championship in 1972. Derby couldn't win the title again the next season, but they did get to the semi-finals of the European Cup, but they lost to Juventus. A lot of people in England thought after the match that the Italian club had paid money to the referee as a bribe. This was never proved. Clough left the club after an argument with Derby's chairman Sam Longson. Clough later became manager of Nottingham Forest F.C., where he went on to win a First Division championship and two European Cups. After Clough. Derby won the league again in 1974-1975, this time with Dave Mackay as manager. He used to play for the club, as captain, under Clough. When Mackay left in 1976, Derby got slowly worse until they went down in 1980. Derby's stay in the Second Division was not a happy one and they were relegated to the Football League Third Division in 1984. It was exactly 100 years since the club formed, and just nine years after their last Championship. The club made Arthur Cox manager. After a two year stay in the Third Division, they were promoted to the Second Division. They won that league the next year, going back up to the First Division in 1987. The club managed to finish 5th in 1989, but it was owned by businessman Robert Maxwell, who was having money problems. He stopped spending money on new players, and sold the club not long before his death. The club was relegated back to the Second Division in 1991 (which changed its name to the First Division a year later when the First Division clubs left to form the FA Premier League). Jim Smith became Derby's manager in 1995. Before the end of the season, Smith took the Rams up to the Premier League for the first time. Recent times. Derby County did well in the 1996-97 season, finishing 12th in the final table with international players like Aljosa Asanovic and Igor Stimac playing well. The club moved into the new 33,000-seat Pride Park Stadium for the 1997-98 season, and went on to finish ninth. Next year they did even better, finishing eighth, but the season after that Derby struggled, and finished 16th. Another bad season followed in 2000-01, as Derby finished 17th in the Premiership - just one place clear of going down. Jim Smith left the club in October 2001 and his assistant manager Colin Todd took over. He kept his job for just 3 months before he was sacked. At the end of January 2002, John Gregory got the manager's job. Derby started well, but then lost seven of their last eight matches and were relegated again after six seasons in a row in the Premiership. It was a bad time to go down. Money owed to the Football League teams by the TV company ITV Digital was never paid, and Derby were one of the clubs to suffer worst. They had to sell their best players and rebuild a team with mostly very young players. They finished 18th after a difficult season. In late March, Gregory was suspended and George Burley came in as a temporary manager. At the end of the season Gregory was sacked and Burley took over fully. Owner Lionel Pickering lost control of the club and a new board of John Sleightholme, Jeremy Keith and Steve Harding came in. Derby finished 20th in the 2003-2004 First Division campaign, but did much better in the 2004-05 season and finished 4th in the Division which was now called the Football League Championship. This meant they won a promotion play-off spot, but lost in the semi-finals to Preston North End. Soon after losing, Burley left. Derby then employed Phil Brown for a short period who was then replaced by the Academy Coach, Terry Westley, who kept the club up in the 2005-06 season. Before the final game of the 2005-06 season a local consortium led by Peter Gadsby, took over the Rams and gave the manager's job to Billy Davies, who left Preston after compensation was agreed by both clubs for his services. The new changes and fresh activity in the transfer market promise a bright future for this founder member of the football league. Following a poor start to the 2007-2008 season which saw Derby achieve just one win in 14 matches Billy Davies has left Derby County FC. Famous players. Many people think the best Rams player ever was Steve Bloomer, one of the highest scoring players in the history of English football. He played for Derby from the late 19th century to just before the First World War. Other top players include the FA Cup winners Peter Doherty, Jackie Stamps and Raich Carter. In more recent years players like Roy McFarland, Archie Gemmill, Colin Todd, Kevin Hector, Steve Powell, Ron Webster, Alan Hinton and Dave Mackay played in the championship winning sides. More recently, the England goalkeeper Peter Shilton, Stefano Eranio and Igor Stimac all played for the Rams. Bobby Davison was also a favourite of Rams fans.

Gardening can be done outside of the home, in city parks, botanical gardens, zoos, amusement parks, theme parks, and around tourist attractions. These types of gardens are cared for by people called gardeners or groundskeepers. Gardening compared with farming. Gardening is related to farming. But farming is done on a much larger scale. A farm may have hundreds of square kilometers of plants and crops. A garden in a person's backyard is usually only measures a few square meters. As well, farming is done as a business, to sell the crops, fruit, and vegetables that are produced. Gardening is done just to produce fruit or vegetables for the gardener's own family.

A mixture can be a liquid, a solid, or a gas. A mixture is not the same as a compound, which is made of two or more elements (different kinds of atoms) connected together. For instance, a mixture of the gases hydrogen and nitrogen contains hydrogen and nitrogen, not the compound ammonia which is made of hydrogen and nitrogen atoms. A solution can be a mixture. For instance, sugar dissolved in water is a mixture. Solids can be mixtures also. Many kinds of soil and rock are mixtures of different minerals.",
   "Chess": "Chess is a game for two players. It is played on a board, with two colors of pieces. The board is a square, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces (eight pawns, two each of knights, bishops, and rooks, and one king and queen). The players in a game of chess are called \"white player\" and \"black player\", depending on the color of pieces they control. Each game starts with the pieces set in the same way, which you can see in the picture. The pieces start out, from left to right for the white player, from right to left for the black player, in the first row in front of the players in this order: rook, knight, bishop, queen, king, bishop, knight, rook. A pawn is placed in the square right in front of each piece. The game commences with the players taking turns moving one piece at a time. White always moves first. Each piece can only move in a special way. A piece cannot move onto a square that has a friendly piece (meaning, a piece of the same color) on it. A piece also cannot move through squares that have other pieces on them. However, a piece can end its move on a square that has an enemy piece on it. If this happens, the enemy piece is \"captured\", meaning it is taken off the board and is not in the game anymore. An alternative version of this game is Transfer Chess. Check and checkmate. When a player makes a move that will let him or her capture the enemy king on the next move, the enemy king is said to be in \"check.\" The player whose king is in danger must use a turn to save the king. A player might save the king by moving the king out of the way, capturing the dangerous piece, or moving another piece between the dangerous piece and the king. If the player whose king is in danger cannot do any of these things, it is called \"checkmate\", and they lose. Many games of chess end when one player sees they are about to lose, and elect to resign rather than prolong a hopeless game. A player may declare, \"Mate in two,\" (or \"three..four...etc.) if they believe the opponent cannot stop them from checkmating in two moves. A game may end in a draw if both players agree that neither can win. Strategy. Chess is a very complex game, and has many different strategies that can be used to win. Most of them are for the beginning of the game, called \"opening moves\", or simply \"openings\". The most popular opening, the King's Pawn Opening, involves the white player moving his king's pawn (e2) foward two spaces (e4). Black can respond in many different ways, opening up possibilities for a very complex game. Other chess openings are more risky. The \"Parham Attack\" is a very risky move that has the white player moving his queen out in the middle of the board and tries to lure other pieces to capture it. If white loses the queen, white is at a serious disadvantage, because black has more pieces out of the starting position than white. However, if the attack succeeds, white will have many more pieces than black, and black's king will most likely be out in the open and undefended.",
   "Gold": "Gold is a soft, heavy, dark yellowish piece of shiny metal that has been used for many thousands of years by people all over the world, for jewelry, as money, and now in tooth fillings and electronic equipment such as computers. It was especially admired as jewelry in early times because of its great luster and beauty. In Exodus it was used as part of the clothes the priests wore. The color of this metal is also called \"gold\". Chemical properties. In chemistry, gold is chemical element 79, a transition metal in Group 11. It has an atomic weight of 199.96 a.m.u. Its symbol is Au, from the Latin word for gold, \"aurum\". Gold is very soft, which means it can be hammered into thin sheets; and ductile, which means it can be pulled into wire. When it is used in money or in jewelry, it is often mixed with silver or some other metal to make it harder. Most metals are gray in color. Gold's yellow color comes from the way that electrons behave in it. There have been many discoveries of gold in Australia. The most important discovery of gold there was probably discovered by Sir Edward Hargraves. He started the first Australian gold rush.",
   "Kilogram": "The kilogram is a metric unit that describes mass. The official kilogram equals the mass of a particular piece of platinum-iridium metal kept in Paris. It is the only SI unit left that is defined such that it needs to be compared to some object. There are now attempts to define the kilogram in a different way, for example by specifying a number of atoms of a certain substance (at a certain temperature). One kilogram is a little more than 2.2 pounds. One tonne is one thousand kilograms. History. In 1879 the piece of metal was made. It was officially chosen to be the kilogram in 1889. It was made of 90% platinum and 10% iridium because both do not rust or corrode the way most metals do. From 1795 to 1799, the unit of mass was not called \"kilogram\" but was named \"grave\". Problems. There are various copies of the original Kilogram. The problem is now that some of these copies have gained or lost some mass. They no longer weigh the same.",
   "Second": "The second (symbol: s) is a unit of time, and one of the seven SI base units. It is the time taken by 9,192,631,770 cycles of radiation that comes from electrons moving between two energy levels of the caesium-133 atom. A second is also 1/60 of a minute, and 1/3600 of an hour. The second (SI symbol: s), sometimes abbreviated sec., is the name of a unit of time, and is the International System of Units (SI) base unit of time. SI prefixes are frequently combined with the word \"second\" to denote subdivisions of the second, \"e.g.\", the millisecond (one thousandth of a second) and nanosecond (one billionth of a second). Though SI prefixes may also be used to form multiples of the second (such as \u201ckilosecond,\u201d or one thousand seconds), such units are rarely used in practice. More commonly encountered, non-SI units of time such as the minute, hour, and day increase by multiples of 60 and 24 (rather than by powers of ten as in the SI system). International second. Under the International System of Units, the second is currently defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom. This definition refers to a caesium atom at rest at a temperature of 0 K (absolute zero). The ground state is defined at zero magnetic field. The second thus defined is equivalent to the ephemeris second. The international standard symbol for a second is s (see ISO 31-1) Historical origin. Originally, the second was known as a \"second minute\", meaning the second minute (i.e. small) division of an hour. The first division was known as a \"prime minute\" and is equivalent to the minute we know today. The factor of 60 comes from the Babylonians who used factors of 60 in their counting system. However, the Babylonians did not subdivide their time units sexagesimally (except for the day). The hour had been defined by the ancient Egyptians as either 1/12 of daytime or 1/12 of nighttime, hence both varied with the seasons. Hellenistic astronomers, including Hipparchus and Ptolemy, defined the hour as 1/24 of a mean solar day. Sexagesimally subdividing this mean solar hour made the second 1/86 400 of a mean solar day. Hellenistic time periods like the mean synodic month were usually specified quite precisely because they were \"calculated\" from carefully selected eclipses separated by hundreds of years\u2014individual \"mean\" synodic months and similar time periods cannot be \"measured\". Nevertheless, with the development of pendulum clocks keeping \"mean time\" (as opposed to the \"apparent time\" displayed by sundials), the second became measurable. The seconds pendulum was proposed as a unit of length as early as 1660 by the Royal Society of London. The duration of a beat or half period (one swing, not back and forth) of a pendulum one metre in length on the earth's surface is approximately one second. In 1956 the second was defined in terms of the period of revolution of the Earth around the Sun for a particular epoch, because by then it had become recognized that the Earth's rotation on its own axis was not sufficiently uniform as a standard of time. The Earth's motion was described in Newcomb's Tables of the Sun, which provides a formula for the motion of the Sun at the epoch 1900 based on astronomical observations made between 1750 and 1892. The second thus defined is This definition was ratified by the Eleventh General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960. The \"tropical year\" in the definition was not measured, but calculated from a formula describing a tropical year which decreased linearly over time, hence the curious reference to a specific \"instantaneous\" tropical year. Because this second was the independent variable of time used in ephemerides of the Sun and Moon during most of the twentieth century (Newcomb's Tables of the Sun were used from 1900 through 1983, and Brown's Tables of the Moon were used from 1920 through 1983), it was called the ephemeris second. With the development of the atomic clock, it was decided to use atomic clocks as the basis of the definition of the second, rather than the revolution of the Earth around the Sun. Following several years of work, Louis Essen from the National Physical Laboratory (Teddington, England) and William Markowitz from the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) determined the relationship between the hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium atom and the ephemeris second. Using a common-view measurement method based on the received signals from radio station WWV, they determined the orbital motion of the Moon about the Earth, from which the apparent motion of the Sun could be inferred, in terms of time as measured by an atomic clock. As a result, in 1967 the Thirteenth General Conference on Weights and Measures defined the second of atomic time in the International System of Units (SI) as The ground state is defined at zero magnetic field. The second thus defined is equivalent to the ephemeris second. The definition of the second was later refined at the 1997 meeting of the BIPM to include the statement The revised definition would seem to imply that the ideal atomic clock would contain a single caesium atom at rest emitting a single frequency. In practice, however, the definition means that high-precision realizations of the second should compensate for the effects of the ambient temperature (black-body radiation) within which atomic clocks operate and extrapolate accordingly to the value of the second as defined above. The second in Role Playing Games. Sometimes in RPGs a second is used to refer to a small period of time or a single turn of combat. It is used as a standard moment of time, and does not necessarily refer to a real second, and could be shorter or longer depending on the scenario.",
   "Orange": "Orange is a color. It is the combination of red and yellow. Orange is the color of an orange fruit, which is the origin of the name of the color. Before the orange fruit was introduced to England in the 1500s, this color was called \"red-yellow\". Meaning of orange. To the human eye, orange is a very \"hot\" color, so it gives the sensation of heat. Nevertheless, orange is not as aggressive as red. Orange increases oxygen supply to the brain, produces an invigorating effect, and stimulates mental activity. As a citrus color, orange is associated with healthy food and stimulates appetite. Orange is the color of fall and harvest. In heraldry, orange is symbolic of strength and endurance. Orange is also the color of the fruit of the same name. Orange has very high visibility, so people can use it to catch attention and highlight the most important elements of their design. Orange is very effective for promoting food products and toys. On road signs, the color orange means there is construction work ahead. It is used for these signs because it can easily be seen even at night. Dark orange can mean deceit and distrust. Red-orange corresponds to desire, sexual passion, pleasure, domination, aggression, and thirst for action. Gold evokes the feeling of prestige. The meaning of gold is illumination, wisdom, and wealth. Gold often symbolizes high quality.",
   "M-theory": "M-theory is a new idea in small-particle physics that is part of superstring theory. The idea, or theory, often causes arguments among scientists, because there is no way to test it to see if it is true. If ever proven true, M-theory and string theory would mean big progress for science. String theory. To understand M-theory someone must first have some knowledge of string theory. For hundreds of years, scientists have thought that the simplest objects in the universe are points, like dots. String theory says that this is wrong and that the simplest objects in the universe are shaped like pieces of string. These strings are so small that even when looked at very closely they look like points. Each basic particle is created by the strings vibrating in different patterns. The reason scientists had not thought of this idea for so long is that strings are much harder to work with than points. They seem to break rules such as causality and special relativity, which says that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light. String theory has been developed because of a very important problem that has existed for almost 100 years. Albert Einstein's theory that describes the universe on very large scales (it is called general relativity), disagrees with two theories that describe things on very small scales (they are called quantum mechanics and the standard model). There are also problems with the Standard Model: it includes about 20 numbers that seem to have no explanation; it has too many \"basic particles\" - some scientists think it needs to have fewer; and it does not include gravity, which is needed to explain weight. Many of these problems can be solved by thinking of basic particles as strings. Now there is only one number with no explanation, which gives the size of the strings. String theory includes particles that cause gravity, called gravitons; finding this out delighted the scientists who work on string theory. So, string theory successfully brings General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics together. But there are some problems with string theory. Normally, we think of the universe as having 4 dimensions, or \"basic directions\". 3 of these basic directions can be thought of as \"up\", \"forward\" and \"left\". The other direction is time. String theory needs 10 basic directions. These six other directions can be explained if they are \"curled up\", so they are much too small to see. For example, if by following the path of a spiral, it is possible to go a great distance along it without moving very far. The 6 other directions can be thought of as tiny spirals - strings can move along them a great distance but not seem to move. This can be looked at as a mathematical trick. A trick that has little to do with the real world that can be seen and touched. Such tricks are allowed, if they give a theory that can better tell us how things work. Another problem with string theory is that there are 5 different versions of it. Each version allows different kinds of strings and says they work in different ways. String theory is supposed to be a \"theory of everything\" so there should be only one version, not 5. M-theory solves this problem. M-theory. In 1995, Edward Witten started what has been called the \"Second Superstring Revolution\" by introducing M-theory to the world. This theory combines the 5 different string theories (along with a previously abandoned attempt to unify General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics called 11D-Supergravity) into one theory. What Witten actually did was to predict that the fact that all these different theories were connected was a result of there being some underlying theory to which they were all approximations of. This theory is somewhat vague in nature and has not yet been pinned down. Additionally, it was found that the equations that required string theory to exist in 10 dimensions were actually approximations as well. The proposed M-theory would need one extra dimension and instead be a theory that takes place in \"11 dimensions\". Witten has himself described this idea in simple terms as the general taking position on a hill-top, the extra space-coordinate, to get a better view of the battlefield's two other dimensions. The combination is accomplished by knitting together a web of relationships between each of the string theories called dualities (specifically, S-duality, T-duality, and U-duality). Each of these dualities provides a way of converting one of the string theories into another. T-duality is probably the most easily explained of the dualities. It has to do with the size, written as R, of the curled up dimensions of the string theories. It was discovered that by taking a Type IIA string theory that has a size R and changing the radius to 1/R the result will end up being what is equivalent to a Type IIB theory of size R. This duality, along with the others, creates connections between all 5 (or 6, if supergravity is counted) theories. The fact that these dualities existed had been known before Witten came up with the idea of M-theory. Additional amusement has come for many in guessing what the M might stand for (possibilities include Matrix, Magic, Muffin, Mystery, Mother and Membrane). Regardless of what the M might possibly mean, M-theory has become one of the most interesting and active areas of research in theoretical physics today. \"For a more technical explanation, see.\"",

It was renamed Jaguar in 1935. Jaguar is owned by the Indian automobile manufacturer Tata Motors Ltd. Jaguar is known for its luxury saloons and sports cars. Jaguar was a private company until it became part of the government-owned British Motor Corporation in 1966. In 1984 it was made private again by Margaret Thatcher. Ford bought Jaguar in 1989. In 1999 it was made part of Ford's \"Premier Automotive Group\" along with Aston Martin, Land Rover, Volvo and Lincoln. The company was originally located in Blackpool, but moved to Coventry. Today factories are at Browns Lane in Coventry, Castle Bromwich in Birmingham and Halewood in Liverpool. Jaguar owns the Daimler car company (not Daimler-Benz). Jaguar bought Daimler in 1960. Daimler is now just a brand for some of Jaguar's saloons. Jaguar has five different saloons: Vanden Plas, Daimler, XJ8, S-Type, and X-Type. Jaguar builds the XK-8 sports car. Sportscar racing.

   "Weapon": "A weapon is an object that can be used to attack or injure a person or animal. People have used weapons since very ancient times. Some of the oldest remains that we have of ancient people are weapons made of stone. Ancient people also used spears and bows and arrows. After people learned to make things of metal, many people used swords. People also built huge machines which could throw rocks to destroy the walls of enemy cities. Some of these machines were called catapults or siege engines. Later, gunpowder was invented in China and the Europeans began using it to make guns and cannons. These weapons were much better than the older weapons, and helped the Europeans to conquer people in many parts of the world. People in many parts of the world used guns such as rifles and shotguns for hunting animals, and handguns for shooting other people. People continued to invent new weapons. In the 1800s, the machine gun was invented, which could shoot many bullets very fast. When airplanes were invented, people began to use them to shoot enemies and to drop bombs on them. They built tanks which had big guns and strong armor. They began to use land mines, a bomb which soldiers hide in the ground, and which explodes when someone walks on it. Poison gas was used in World War I. In World War II, Germany began to use missiles to carry bombs to England. At the end of World War II, the United States used atomic bombs (nuclear bombs) to destroy the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After World War II, people continued to develop new weapons. Now many people are concerned about weapons of mass destruction, weapons that can kill many people very fast, and are usually cheap and easy to make and use. One kind of weapon of mass destruction is poison gas. New kinds of poison gas, such as nerve gas, are much more powerful than the old kinds. Another kind of weapon of mass destruction is disease germs, which could be used to make many people sick and maybe kill them. There are also many land mines which have been buried in the ground in many countries, and which kill and injure many people every year. Old weapons still kill many people in wars and fighting. In wars in Africa in the 1990s and early 21st century, many people were killed with machetes (big knives). People sometimes try to make laws, treaties, and international agreements to try to control weapons because they are worried about all the killing done with them. Laws vary from country to country, for example, in the United States, the \"right to keep and bear arms\" is guaranteed to all citizens by the Constitution. A country may say that people in that country cannot keep or use guns, or that people can only keep guns when the government says it is okay. Countries may agree with each other that they should not use certain weapons against each other, or should not have a lot of missiles.",

   "River Thames": "The River Thames is a large river in England. It goes through London the capital city of the United Kingdom. The Thames is 346 kilometres (215 statute miles) long, and its source is near the village of Kemble in the Cotswolds; it flows through Oxford (where it is called \"Isis\", a shortening of its Latin name), Reading, Maidenhead, Eton and then Windsor. From the outskirts of Greater London, it passes Syon House, Hampton Court, and Richmond (with the famous view of the Thames from Richmond Hill), and Kew. Then it passes through London, then Greenwich and Dartford before it enters the sea in an estuary, The Nore. Part of the area west of London is sometimes called the Thames Valley, and the area east of Tower Bridge development agencies and Ministers is called \"Thames Gateway\". About 90 kilometres from the sea, above London, the river begins to show the tide caused by the North Sea. It is said that London was made capital of Roman Britain at the spot where the tides reached in 43 AD, but different things have pushed this spot farther up the river in the over 2000 years since then. At London, the water is slightly salty with sea salt. History. Like the Celts who lived in the area, the Romans called the river \"Thamesis\". The Thames was an important way to go between London and Westminster in the 16th and 17th centuries. The guild of watermen took Londoners back and forth by ferry. One of them, John Taylor, the Water Poet (1580\u20141653), described the river in a poem. In the 17th century and 18th century, at a time some call the \"Little Ice Age\", the Thames often froze over in the winter. This led to the first \"Frost Fair\" in 1607, with a tent city set up on the river with lots of odd amusements, like ice bowling. The last time the river froze over was in 1814. The building of a new London Bridge in 1825 may have helped stop it from freezing: the new bridge had fewer pillars than the old, allowing the river to flow more easily, and stopping it from flowing slowly enough to freeze in cold winters. By the 18th century, the Thames was one of the world's busiest waterways, as London became the centre of the very big British Empire. During this time one of the worst river disasters in England took place on September 3, 1878 on the Thames, when the crowded pleasure boat \"Princess Alice\" crashed into the \"Bywell Castle\" killing over 640 people. In the 'Great Stink' of 1858, pollution in the river became so bad that the House of Commons at Westminster had to quit sitting. There was then a a big attempt to hold the city's sewage by building huge sewers on the north and south river banks, led by engineer Joseph Bazalgette. The coming of rail transport and road transport, and the decline of the Empire in the years following 1914, have made the river less important than it was. London itself is no longer used much as a port, and the \"Port of London\" has moved down the river to Tilbury. The Thames has been greatly cleaned up, and life has returned to its dead waters. In the early 1980s, the Thames Barrier was opened to control flooding. It is used many times a year to stop water damage to London's low lying areas up the river. There are many bridges and tunnels crossing the Thames, including Tower Bridge, London Bridge, Lambeth Bridge, and the Dartford Crossing. The Thames in literature. Many books have been written about the Thames. \"Three Men in a Boat\" by Jerome K. Jerome describes a boat trip up the Thames. Somewhere near Oxford is where the Liddells were rowing in the poem at the start of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\". Somewhere near here was where Alice fell asleep in the book. The river is named in both \"The Wind in the Willows\" and the play \"Toad of Toad Hall\". In books set in London you will find Sherlock Holmes looking for a boat in \"A Study in Scarlet\". Bill Sykes kills Nancy just near the river, in Charles Dickens's classic novel \" Oliver Twist\". Crossings of the Thames. See Crossings of the River Thames for a full article.

Organisms can either be grouped as male or female. Female humans are called women and their bodies are different from male humans (who are called men). A woman has a vagina between her legs (a male has a penis) which is the main sexual organ. They also have breasts with milk glands, which allow them to nurse (feed) infants. A woman's shoulders are usually not as wide as a man's, but women usually have wider hips than men, because they need wide hips to be able to give birth. Women who become pregnant are encouraged by the medical community to seek professional care from an obstetrician or a gynecologist in order to prevent complications. Likewise, women should see a gynecologist regularly for routine screening exams for cancer.",

   "Christmas": "Christmas is a Christian holiday that celebrates the birth of Jesus. Christians believe that he is Christ, the Son of God. Christmas means \"Feast day of Christ\". However, it is not pronounced as \"Christ Mass\"; it is pronounced \"Kriss-muhss\". The day known as Christmas Day is celebrated on the 25th of December (This date is different for Orthodox Christians). Christmas is one of the holiest times of the year, when it is believed by Christians that God sent Jesus to be born and to live among people and to save sinners from a life apart from God. The other important Christian Holy Days are at Easter when the death and resurrection of Jesus are celebrated. The season of Christmas begins on a Sunday, about four weeks before Christmas Day and is called Advent. It ends on January 6, known as the \"Epiphany\" or the Twelfth Day of Christmas. Christmas is celebrated by Christian people all over the world, and is also kept as a time of celebration by many people who are not Christian but enjoy the traditions. The traditions are different from country to country, but they nearly always include a feast, giving gifts or cards, and enjoying church or public festivities such as singing Christmas songs. Christmastime, as it is often called, is in the winter of the Northern Hemisphere, at a time when there were already ancient festivals. Some of the traditions that are used for Christmas are older than Christmas, or come from other non-Christian traditions such as Yule. Other festivals at this time of year include Jewish Hanukkah. Modern traditions of Christmas often focus on the giving of gifts. Stores use this time of year to sell a lot of goods, and so start advertising for \"Holiday Season\" shopping for at least a month before Christmas, often showing a Santa Claus. Christmas in the Gospels. Christmas celebrates the birth of Jesus. The story of how this happened is told in part of the Bible known as the Gospels. There are four Gospels telling the life of Jesus. The Gospel of Luke tells the most about his birth, and the Gospel of Matthew tells another part of the story. The Gospel of John says that Jesus came from God to bring his \"Word\" or message to all people. The Gospels say that many years before Jesus' birth, prophets had told a promise to the Jewish people that God would send them a Messiah, or holy teacher. Christians believe that the promised Messiah was Jesus. His mother was a young woman called Mary, who was engaged, but not yet married to a carpenter called Joseph. Joseph found out that Mary was pregnant and was upset. He was wondering what he should do, when an angel came from God to tell him that the baby was the Holy One. The angel said that he must \"name the baby\". This was a sign that he would take care of it like his own child. At this time, the Middle East was ruled by the Romans. An order came that all the people had to travel back to their home town, to put their names on the taxation lists. Joseph took his new wife to Bethlehem. There was nowhere for them to stay, except a stable where the animals slept. This is where the baby was born. Joseph called him Jesus, as the angel had said. The baby Jesus had two lots of visitors. On the night he was born, angels told some shepherds in the fields that they would find a newborn king lying in an animals' feed bin (or \"manger\"). Jesus' other visitors were some wise men who saw a new star in the sky and followed it, until they found the house where the family was now living and gave the young child expensive gifts of gold, incense and a precious herb called myrrh. (The wise men are often traditionally called the Three Kings, because there were three very expensive presents.) All these parts of the Christmas story are remembered and celebrated in different ways at Christmas: in pictures, songs, plays, stories and in models that are called \"creches\" or \"presepe\". Date of celebration. Most Christian countries of the world use a calendar called the Gregorian Calendar, but some churches use a calendar called the Julian Calendar. Most Christians, such as those of the Catholic and Protestant Churches, celebrate the birth of Jesus on December 25. The Eastern Orthodox Church still uses the Julian Calendar. They celebrate Christmas on December 25 in the Julian Calendar, but because of the difference between the calendars it is the 7th of January in the modern Gregorian Calendar. Some Christians, like Jehovah's Witnesses, do not celebrate Christmas because there is no instruction from Jesus in the Bible which tells Christians to celebrate his birth. Mormons celebrate Christmas on December 25th but they believe that Christ's actual birth took place on April 6th. Nowadays historians believe that Jesus was probably not born on December 25, or even at that time of year. It is more likely that he was born in the Spring or the Autumn. It is thought that the date of Christmas was chosen because there was already an important feast at that time: the Zoroastrians and Romans used to celebrate a feast to the god Mithras on December 25th. Historians believe this date was used by the Catholic Church to replace the pagan rites that took place at that time of the year. Advent. The Season of Advent, which begins on a Sunday about four weeks before Christmas Day, is celebrated by the Catholic and Anglican Churches, as well as some others. It is a time for people to prepare themselves for two different things: for the coming of the baby Jesus and Christmas, and for the second coming of Jesus, when he shall rule over all the Earth in peace. Not all Christian people remember Advent. Some people use it as a time of fasting, study, meditation and prayer. Special Advent Calendars are made for children, with pictures or treats for each day of Advent. Generally, Advent is a time when many people are very busy in preparation for Christmas Day, cleaning and decorating, buying food and presents, writing cards and letters, and cooking the Christmas feast. Celebrations. Before the 4th century AD, Christians could only worship and celebrate in secret. The feast of Christmas probably began while Constantine was the Emperor of Rome, because it was he who made Christianity a legal religion and built some of Rome's oldest churches. Some old stone coffins or \"sarcophagi\" from this time are carved with pictures of Mary and baby Jesus and the Wise Men. Through the Middle Ages Christmas was celebrated with feasting, singing and plays. The plays were held in churches, and also in castles and in market places, where a big hay waggon was sometimes used as a stage. Because Advent was a time of prayer and preparation, most parties were held after Christmas, rather than before it. The main pre-Christmas celebration was the Feast of St. Nicholas on December 6. In some countries, particularly the Netherlands, the tradition grew for children to receive presents on this day, rather than Christmas Day. The name of Saint Nicholas, is now remembered in many countries as Santa Claus. Another traditional festivity that takes place during Advent is the Feast of St Lucy (Santa Lucia) on December 13th which is particularly celebrated in Scandinavia, where girls take part in candlelit processions, and the daughters of the house must rise early to bring coffee or chocolate to the family. For many centuries, the celebration of Christmas often began with a church service or mass, which lasted from late at night to after midnight on Christmas morning. Christmas Day was a time of feasting. On the following day, the Feast of St Stephen, people from rich households would carry boxes of food out to the street for the poor and hungry. Many people would go back to work but employers would give gifts of money to their workers. The Holy Days continued with the feast of St John and Holy Innocents' Day. The feasting and parties ended on the Feast of the Epiphany, the day of the Three Wise Men, often called the \"Three Kings\". The season is nowadays remembered by the song \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\". William Shakespeare wrote a play to be performed as part of the celebration, called \"Twelfth Night\". Nowadays, for many people, Christmas has become a time when having parties, sending messages to family and friends and giving presents has become more important than the celebration of Jesus' birth. Manufacturers and stores have responded to the feasting and present-giving with lots of advertising, decorations and displays. This is known as Commercialism, and many Christian people are annoyed by it. In the US, the Christmas displays are put up right after Thanksgiving, late in November. In some countries such as Australia, department stores and shopping malls put up decorations at the beginning of November. Town councils celebrate by decorating streets and squares, and providing Christmas entertainment for shoppers. In countries of the Southern Hemisphere, where Christmas falls in Summer, there is a tradition of open-air Carol Services, often organised by the town council, which are attended by thousands of people. Many Christians celebrate Christmas by attending church, and with prayers and singing. Many people are worried that the \"true meaning of Christmas\" has been lost, because of the emphasis on giving and receiving presents. However, when most people, even those who are not Christian, talk about the \"true meaning of Christmas\", they are thinking of the words that the angels spoke to the shepherds: \"Peace on Earth and Goodwill to all people!\" Christmas Traditions. Christmas traditions are of several types. There are traditions of the church, traditions which are public celebrations and traditions that are kept by families. These traditions are different in different times, places, cultures and even families. Traditions of the Church===. The celebration of Christmas is a very important time for churches. Almost every church has special services or celebrations. Here are some of the ways that churches celebrate Christmas. The Crib. It is the custom in many churches to set up a Crib (or \"Creche\") scene of the \"Nativity\" or birth of Jesus. The first scene of this type was set up by St. Francis of Asissi in the 13th century. They have been very popular in Italy ever since then, and the custom has spread to other countries. Nativity scenes can be large with life-sized statues, or they can be tiny enough to fit in a matchbox. They are made of many different things including carved and painted wood, brightly coloured ceramics (pottery), painted paper glued to boards, and mixtures of material with clay, wood, cloth, straw and metal used for different parts. Advent wreaths. The Advent wreath is a circle of leaves, usually pine boughs, ivy and holly, with five candles in it which is hung up in a church. The candles are lit on each Sunday in Advent, and the central candle is lit on Christmas morning. Churches are often decked with green branches and leaves, and many churches also have a Christmas tree. Bible readings. Each year at Christmas there are a series of Bible readings from the Gospels that tell the story of the birth of Jesus. These are combined with other readings that tell about the sinfulness of humans, and how God promised to send the Messiah. On Christmas morning the main Bible reading that is usually used in churches is not part of the story of Jesus' birth. It is the part of the Gospel of John that says that Jesus is the \"Word of God\" (God's communication with people) who was with God before the world began, and who came to earth to teach all people to become the children of God. Carols by Candlelight. A popular tradition in many churches is the Carol Service which is often lit only by candles. The carol service generally has lots of singing and Bible readings. There is a tradition in England which began in the Temple Church in London and has now spread to many other places for a service of \"Nine Lessons and Carols\". The lessons are the Bible readings. Some carols are sung by a choir and others by the choir and people (the congregation). Every year one of these services is recorded in a large English Church, often King's College Chapel in Cambridge, and is broadcast on radio and television to be enjoyed by people who love good music and carol singing, but particularly for people who cannot go to a Christmas service. Public and commercial celebrations. Many cities and towns celebrate Christmas by putting up decorations. These may be banners and bunting which are strung from buildings or lampposts. They may be Christmas lights which can also decorate buildings and street trees. Many large cities put up a huge Christmas tree in a public place, such as those in Trafalgar Square in London, Times Square in New York and Martin Place in Sydney. This is often combined with an appeal to the people of the city to give money or gifts to help the poor and needy. In many cities, the usual shopping hours are made longer before Christmas so that workers have more time to buy Christmas food and presents. Shop windows are often decorated with Christmas scenes, with large department stores often having animated scenes to entertain children. Shopping malls and big stores often have a Santa Claus, who sits on a throne, while children tell him what they want for Christmas, and have their photos taken. Many towns hold Christmas parades, street entertainment and concerts. Some towns have a tradition of carols with a choir and entertainers in the town hall, while in Australia and New Zealand, these concerts of Christmas entertainment and carols are usually held outdoors, in parks or even on beaches, with families bringing picnics. The arrival of Santa Claus at the end of the evening is accompanied by a firework display. A traditional part of Christmas is the theatre entertainment. This includes the performance of classical music such as Handel's Messiah as well as orchestral concerts and band recitals. Pantomimes are often played at Christmas and favourites include \"Peter Pan and Wendy\" and \"Cinderella\". Many children's movies are released during the Christmas season. Because many people feel very lonely, hungry and sad at Christmas, many cities, churches, charities and service organisations try to help the poor and lonely by providing Christmas food and gifts for poor families, and Christmas parties for people who are hungry or who are lonely and without any friends or family. Family celebrations. Family celebrations are often very different from each other, depending on where a family comes from, and the customs that have grown in particular families. Family get-togethers. Most families think of Christmas as a time to get together with other members of the family. People often travel from far away to be with other family members at Christmas. Those people who cannot travel often make long-distance phone calls on Christmas Day. Many people also see Christmas as a time to reach out to others that they know might be lonely, and invite them to dinner on Christmas Day. Christmas is seen as a time for people of all ages to have fun together, for cousins to get to know each other, for grandparents to see their grandchildren and for the family to admire the babies that have been born during the year. Big family parties are supposed to be a time of joy, but unfortunately some family members often store up their troubles and have big fights at Christmas time. Family traditions are very different. Some families might all go off to church together, to a Carol Service, a Midnight Mass, or a Christmas Morning service. Some families are pulled out of bed very early by children who want to open their presents. In other families, presents are given on St. Nicholas Day, on Christmas Eve or not until after church on Christmas morning. The Christmas feast might start on Christmas Eve, with a special breakfast on Christmas morning, or at midday on Christmas Day. Some families have a tradition of carol singing, and might go around the streets, to hospitals and other such places singing with members of their church. Other families like to watch certain television programs together, which might include carol services and the Queen's Message. Some families use Christmas as a time to play music and sing together, or to read a favourite book such as \"A Christmas Carol\" by Charles Dickens. In countries in the Southern Hemisphere, a visit to the beach or a swim in a pool is often part of the Christmas Day tradition. Christmas dinner. Christmas Dinner, usually eaten in the middle of the day, is an important part of the family celebration. The food differs from country to country and also from family to family. In the Northern Hemisphere, roasted meat and vegetables is generally the main course of the meal. Often several types of meat are served, which may include turkey, ham, roast beef or lamb. There are often several courses, with special treats that are usually only eaten at Christmas. In English-speaking countries, the traditional dessert is Christmas plum pudding. Nowadays these are often bought from bakers, but many people make their own to a family recipe. The tradition came from the Middle Ages when the pudding was used to preserve some of the fruit from the Autumn until the mid-winter. A traditional pudding is baked six weeks before Christmas and is left tied up in a cloth, in a cool place. Stirring the pudding is sometimes a family tradition, with everyone making a wish as they stir. Traditionally a silver coin would be stirred into the pudding, to bring luck to the person who found it. Nowadays most coins cannot be used because they taste horrible and may be poisonous. Some families use old coins or silver charms. On Christmas Day the pudding must be boiled in a pot for several hours. When it is served, the cloth is cut off, the pudding is soused in brandy and set alight before it is carried to the table. Many families have a Christmas Cake or a special bread instead of a pudding (or as well as a pudding). These are very different depending on the country, but often have \"marzipan\" which is made from almonds and is traditional in many countries at Christmas. In France \"Buche de Noel\" or gingerbread men and women are decorated and hung on the Christmas tree. In Scotland a pastry biscuit called shortbread is made and has become a popular tradition in many countries. A German tradition is \"pfeffern\u00fcsse\", spiced cookies rolled in powdered sugar. Other Christmas food includes raisins, sultanas, ginger, Turkish delight, almonds, chocolates, caramel toffee, candy canes and oranges. Many families also prepare mulled wine which is warmed with cinnamon and nutmeg or egg nogs, a sweet drink made of milk, sugar, eggs, nutmeg and sometimes alcohol. In the Southern Hemisphere, the traditional roast dinner is often replaced with cold cuts of meat, and served with salads. The first course might be prawn cocktail or a cold soup like borsch. The plum pudding might be served with icecream. White wine and beer are both served cold (beer is kept in a refrigerator). Christmas dinner may be served on the veranda, or sometimes as a picnic. Tree and decorations. In most homes when Christmas is celebrated, people set up a Christmas tree in the house. This old Yuletide custom began in Germany as the \"Tannenbaum\" (German for \"Fir Tree\"). These are traditionally evergreens, the best type being the Fir Tree which does not shed its needles or lose its fragrance. The tree may be a cut tree that is bought from a plantation or taken from the forest. Artificial trees are sometimes preferred to real trees, particularly in Australia where there are no Fir Trees and the only types that can be bought are very messy and dry out fast in the hot weather. The Christmas tree is decorated with lights, shiny coloured balls, sparkly tinsel and other ornaments. A wreath of leaves or pine is often put on the front door of a house as a sign of welcome. Other plants that have special significance at Christmas are holly which is used as decoration and mistletoe which is hung in the centre of a room. The tradition is that people who meet under the mistletoe must kiss. Many people decorate their homes at Christmas time. These decorations and the Christmas tree are generally inside, but may be put where they can also be seen through a window by people passing by. In the mid 20th century there grew up a custom for decorating the outside of houses as well. These decorations may be just a few lights around the porch, or hundreds of lights and colourful Christmas figures decorating the whole house and garden. Some neighbourhoods hold competitions for the best-decorated house, and driving around the streets to look at them has become another family tradition. Cards and presents. The giving of gifts at Christmas comes from several different ideas. One is that God gave his son, Jesus, to the world at Christmas. There is also the story of the Wise Men who came to the baby Jesus with three gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh. For many centuries it has been the custom for people to give small gifts at Christmas, and also to give generously to the poor and needy to help them through the winter. Another tradition has become linked to this one, and the result is the tradition of Santa Claus, or Father Christmas as he is sometimes called, and who is nowadays thought by many children to be the bringer of presents. In the 4th century, in a Greek village that is now part of Turkey, there was a good man who would secretly given presents to the poor to help them. He became a bishop and is called Saint Nicholas. Over the centuries, he became a very popular saint and lots of churches were named after him. He was very popular in places where there were lots of sailors. One of those places was the Netherlands. In the Netherlands and many other European countries, presents are given on the feast of Saint Nicholas, December 6th. Traditionally, the presents are not big, and are sometimes hidden, or have a funny joke or poem that must be read. In many towns of Europe a man dressed in bishop's robes comes on a horse or in a boat, acting as St. Nicholas. His name was often shortened to Sante Claus, or Santa Claus in English. In English speaking countries, where presents are usually given on Christmas day, not December 6th, Santa Claus, (or Father Christmas) is usually thought of as coming on Christmas Night, when his magic sleigh is pulled across the sky by reindeer, and he comes into houses through the chimney. While in Europe, children put out their shoes for St. Nicholas, the English tradition is to hang up stockings (or long socks) in front of the fireplace. Santa Claus would traditionally fill the socks or shoes with nuts, raisins, chocolates and an orange. Nowadays children usually get much more expensive presents, and hang up pillow cases or have the presents in a big pile under the Christmas tree. Another Christmas tradition is the sending of cards to friends and relatives. These contain warm greetings and may also have a letter telling all the things that have happened to the person or family during the year. Other holidays around Christmas. There are other holidays that take place around Christmas time. The Jewish people celebrate Chanukkah, although this feast of lights is not their holiest time of the year. Chanukkah is a remembrance of the miracle of Jewish survival against mighty empires (on this occasion, 165 BCE, against the Seleucid Greeks). A popular later legend suggested that one day's worth of oil for the candelabra in the Temple in Jerusalem miraculously lasted for 8 days whilst new oil was prepared, after the Jews had fought off their enemy and rededicated the Temple. Some African Americans celebrate Kwanzaa, although many African Americans have a deeply rooted Christian faith, so they may celebrate Christmas first and Kwanzaa as a cultural versus spiritual celebration. For Wiccans and Neopagans, Yule celebrates the rebirth of the earth during the winter solstice (usually December 20-22). At Yule, the Holly King, God of winter, is taken over by the Oak King, God of Spring or rebirth, also known as the Divine Child. Common shared traditions between Yule and Christmas include: caroling, decorating the Yule tree, kissing under the mistletoe and honoring Kriss Kringle (Santa Claus), the Germanic God of Yule. Some secular or non religious groups also celebrate Yule on the Winter Solstice as the middle of winter and for its cultural importance.",
   "Power": "The Chinese call it chi. The Japanese call it kiai.",
   "Perimeter": "In geometry, perimeter is the distance around a flat object. For example, all four sides of a square rhombus have the same length, so a rhombus with side length 2 inches would have a perimeter of 8 inches (2+2+2+2=8). Real-life objects have perimeters as well. A football field, including the end zones, is 360 feet long and 160 feet wide. So the perimeter of the field is 360+160+360+160=1040 feet. The perimeter of a circle is usually called the circumference. It may be calculated by multiplying the diameter times \"Pi\". Pi is a constant which is equal to 3.14159; however, the places to the right of the decimal are endless. The number of places used depend on the accuracy required for the result.",
   "Nation": "A nation is an area of land ruled by a person or group of people. No one else can make rules for that nation. The word \"nation\" comes from a word meaning \"birth\" or \"place of birth.\" The adjective is national. Some nations are people with a particular belief, such as the Vatican City, or ethnic group, such as Armenia. Others share an idea, such as Democracy in the United States or Communism in China. Some nations are controlled by a small minority who have all the power, such as Saudi Arabia, who hold the nation together with the use of this power. Some of these may also be combined. The highest lawful authority of most nations is a constitution, which is a document which states clearly what kinds of power the rulers have and how new laws must be made. Many others are ruled by a single person who holds an \"office\" (position), such as a King or Pope, or from a long legal tradition without an official Constitution, such as the United Kingdom.",
   "Metal": "Metals are hard, shiny materials that are used a lot. Some metals are aluminium, copper, iron, steel, tin, gold, lead, silver, titanium, uranium, and zinc. The study of metals is very important and is called metallurgy. The ways that metals are alike (properties of metals). Most metals are hard, shiny, they feel heavy (dense) and melt only when they are very hot. Lumps of metal will make a bell-like sound when they are hit with something heavy (they are sonorous). Heat and electricity can easily pass through a metal (it is conductive). A lump of metal can be beaten into a thin sheet (it is malleable) or can be pulled into thin wires (it is ductile). Use of metals. Metals are very useful to people. They are used to make tools because they can be strong and easy to shape. Iron and steel have been used to make bridges, buildings, or ships. Some metals are used to make items like coins because they are hard and will not wear away quickly. For example copper (which is shiny and red in color), aluminum (which is shiny and white), gold (which is yellow), and silver and nickel (also white). Some metals, like steel, can be made sharp so they can be used to make knives, axes or razors. Metals with high value, like gold, silver and platinum are often used to make jewelery. Metals are also used to make fasteners and screws. Pots used for cooking can be made from copper, aluminum, steel or iron. Lead is very heavy and dense and can be used as ballast in boats to stop them from turning over. Alloys of metals. People first began making things from metal over 6000 years ago, when they discovered how to get copper from its ore. They then learned how to make a harder alloy, bronze, by adding tin to the copper. About 3000 years ago, they discovered iron. By adding small amounts of carbon to iron, they found that they could make a particularly useful alloy \u2013 steel. Metals in chemistry. In chemistry, metal is a word for a group of chemical elements that have certain properties. It is easy for the atoms of a metal to lose an electron and become positive ions, or cations. In this way, metals are not like the other two kinds of elements - the nonmetals and the metalloids. On the periodic table, we can draw a straight line from the element boron (symbol B) to the element polonium (symbol Po). The elements that this line passes through are the metalloids. The elements that are above and to the right of this line are the nonmetals. The rest of the elements are the metals. Most of the properties of metals are because the atoms in the metal do not hold onto their electrons very tightly. Each atom is separated from the others by a thin layer of valence electrons. However, some metals are different. An example is the metal sodium. It is soft, melts at a low temperature, and is so light, it floats on water. People should not try this though, because another property of sodium is that it explodes when it touches water. Most metals are chemically stable, and do not react easily. (Some of the metals do react. These are the alkali metals like sodium (symbol Na) and the alkaline earth metals like calcium (symbol Ca).) When metals do react, they often react with oxygen. The oxides of metals are basic. The oxides of nonmetals are acidic. However, most of the elements on the periodic table are metals. Compounds, which have metal atoms combined with other atoms to make molecules, are probably the most common things on the Earth. For example, common salt is a compound of sodium. Metals in history. The use of metals is said to be the thing that makes people different from animals. Before they used metals, people made tools from stones, wood, and animal bones. This is now called the Stone Age. No-one knows when the first metal was found and used. It was probably what is called native copper, which is sometimes found in large lumps on the ground. People learned to make this into copper tools and other things, although, for a metal, it is quite soft. When it was melted over fire, people learned how to make an alloy called bronze, which is much harder and stronger than copper. People made knives and weapons from bronze. This time in human history, after about 3300 BC is often called the Bronze Age, that is, the time of bronze tools and weapons. Around the year 1200 BC some people learned to make iron tools and weapons. These were even harder and stronger than bronze and this was an advantage in war. The time of iron tools and weapons is now called the Iron Age Metals have been very important in human history and civilization. Iron and steel were important in the making of machines. Gold and silver were used as money in order to allow people to trade, that is, exchange goods and services over long distances. Many people thought that finding metals was a way to get rich. There have been many times when gold was found and people moved quickly in large numbers to those places for example, Central and South America after the year 1500, and many places after the year 1800 (the United States of America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa). These are often called Gold Rushes. Metals in astronomy. In astronomy, a metal is any element other than hydrogen or helium. This is because these two elements (and sometimes lithium) are the only ones that form outside stars. In the sky, a telescope can see the signs of metals and then the astronomer knows that there are stars.",
   "Property": "Ownership. Property is something that belongs to someone. If someone buys a car, the car becomes their property. The Statue of Liberty is the property of the people of the United States. People who deal with buying or selling houses will often talk about \"properties\", meaning houses, apartments, offices etc. Characteristics. Properties can also mean the things that make something interesting: the things that give it its characteristics. For example: \"Elasticity is a property of rubber\", in other words: rubber is elastic. This is close to the meaning for chemistry (see below). Chemistry. In chemistry, properties refer to the things that describe a material. For example, water \"is liquid under normal conditions\", \"boils at 100 degrees\", \"is colourless\", \"is odorless\", and so on. All these descriptions are properties of water. Theatre. In the theatre properties are things which are used in the performance of a play or opera. Anything that is used but is not part of the scenery (the set) is a property (or \"prop\" for short), e.g. furniture, a tree, a book that an actor pretends to read, a pipe that they smoke. The props are looked after by a properties master. Sometimes, for small things like books or fans, it is the actor who is responsible for making sure he has the prop. This is called a \"personal prop\".",

They play in the Welsh League. They came third in the Welsh league in 1992 but have only had success at a regional level.",
   "Mississippi River": "The Mississippi River is the longest river in the United States. It is one of the longest rivers in the world. The name \"Mississippi\" comes from a Native American name that means \"big river.\" The source of the Mississippi is in the state of Minnesota, near the border with Canada. The Mississippi flows south through the middle of the United States. It flows past the states of Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Mississippi. The mouth of the Mississippi is in the state of Louisiana, south of the city of New Orleans. The Mississippi flows into the Gulf of Mexico. The Mississippi has many large tributaries, or rivers that flow into it. The watershed of the Mississippi covers much of the United States. This means that the Mississippi and its tributaries drain much of the United States. The Mississippi has been extremely important for transportation in the history of the United States. When the United States first became a nation, the Mississippi River was the western boundary of the United States. At the end of the Mississippi there is a zone in the Gulf of Mexico where very few animals can survive comfortably because of the fertilizer and other chemicals that run off of farms into the river and her tributaries, which then dump them into the gulf.",
   "Watershed": "Watershed is a geographic term about rivers. It is an area of land. All water that falls on the watershed flows into one river. It can flow directly into the river or go through tribes (smaller rivers that flow into the bigger river) first. The watershed of a river can be very large. For example, the watershed of the Mississippi River covers more than half of the United States. That means that over half of the United States is drained by the Mississippi and its tributaries.",
   "Great Plains": "The Great Plains is a series of big plains in Canada and the United States.",
   "Myth": "A myth is a story which may or may not be true. Myths are generally very old. This means there are no records or other proof that they happened. We know about them from older people telling them to younger people. Some myths may have started as 'true' stories but as people told and re-told them, they may have changed some parts, so they are less 'true'. They may have changed them by mistake, or to make them more interesting. All cultures have myths. Stories about the Greek and Roman gods and goddesses are myths. Many people believe in mythological animals and gods. These animals or gods may have control or has power over a part of human or natural life. For example, the Greek god named Zeus had powers over lightning and storms. Whenever Zeus wanted to, he could make a storm, and that he made storms to show his anger. Another example is that of the Egyptian god, Atum, who was said to be the creator of everything in the world. In Hindu mythology, the cause of thunderstorms was said to be the wrath of Indra, the chief of all gods. His most powerful weapon was the \"Vajra\" 1, or thunderbolt. It was said that no one could survive after an attack from this weapon. Mythology. All cultures have developed their own mythology over time. Mythology includes the legends of their history, their religions, their stores of how the world was created, and their heroes. These stories have great symbolic power, and this may be a major reason why they survive as long as they do, sometimes for thousands of years. A collection of myths is called a mythos, e.g. 'the Roman mythos.' A collection of those is called a mythoi, e.g. 'the Greek and Roman mythoi.' One important type of myth is the creation myth, which describes how that culture believes the universe, or 'world' was created. Scientists generally believe that the universe was created in an event called \"The Big Bang\", a natural event. But now, there is talk within the scientific community about what existed before the Big Bang. To those are comfortable with the Big Bang as the ultimate, or only solution to the question of the beginning of the universe, the Big Bang may have itself become a myth. Not so long ago the Milky Way was believed to be the only galaxy; scientists then had trouble accepting other competing theories, or ideas. Myths are often final answers with great authority, and strong emotional ties. Another important, and myth common to many cultures is the Trickster myth. A 'trickster' is a god, or hero, and very often an animal who plays tricks or jokes on humans in order to bring them wisdom or help them question their beliefs. Examples of tricksters include the fox in Europe, the crow and the coyote for North American natives, the spider \"Anansi\" in Jamaica. There are many more. Joseph Campbell was considered by some people to be a leading Western authority on myth and the history of spirituality. Historians' views on myths. Although myths are often considered to be stories of events that have not happened, many historians consider myths to be accounts of actual events that have become connected with strong symbolic meaning, or that have been changed, or shifted in time or place, or even reversed. One way of thinking about this process is to imagine 'myths' as lying at the far end of an imaginary line or 'continuum'. At one end of the line is 'dispassionate account', and 'legendary occurrence' or'mythical status' is near the other end. As an event progresses toward the 'mythical' end of this line or continuum, the way people think, feel and say about the event changes. It may gain greater historical significance while the 'facts' become less important. By the time one arrives at the mythical end of the line, the story has \"taken on a life of its own\" and the facts of the original event have become almost irrelevant, or unimportant. This process occurs in part because the events described become detached from their original context or situation and new context is substituted, often through analogy with current or recent events. Some Greek myths originated in Classical times to provide explanations for inexplicable features of local cult practices, to account for the local epithet of one of the Olympian gods, to interpret depictions of half-remembered figures, events, or account for the deities' attributes or entheogens, even to make sense of ancient icons, much as myths are invented to \"explain\" heraldic charges, the origins of which has become arcane with the passing of time. Conversely, descriptions of recent events are re-emphasised to make them seem to be analogous with the commonly known story. This technique has been used by Right-wing conservatives in America with text from the Bible (e.g. Revelation), and was used in the Russian Communist era in propaganda about political situations with misleading references to class struggles. Even today the fitness of the Emperor of Japan is based partly on his distant descent from the Goddess of the Sun. Other uses. Myths are not the same as fables, folktales, fairy tales, anecdotes, or simple fiction, but sloppy usage has blurred the distinctions in many people's minds. The term \"myth\" is sometimes used pejoratively in reference to common beliefs of a culture or for the beliefs of a religion to imply that the story is both fanciful and fictional. Myth is often used to refer to a commonly held but erroneous belief. Compare urban myth, the secular mythology of modern culture. The terms urban myth and urban legend are sometimes used to describe something that is false, but, strictly speaking, those can be either true or false as well.",
   "Minnesota River": "The Minnesota River is a river in the United States. It is in the northern United States, in the state of Minnesota. It is a tributary of the Mississippi River. It is about 534 km long. The source of the river is a lake in western Minnesota. The lake is called Big Stone Lake. The lake is on the border between the state of Minnesota and the state of South Dakota. From its source, the Minnesota flows southeast. At Mankato, it turns northeast.

The source of the Wisconsin is in the forests of northern Wisconsin. The source is a small lake on the border between Wisconsin and Michigan. The river flows south across Wisconsin. It flows through a plain made by a glacier during the last ice age. It passes the cities of Wausau and Stevens Point. In southern Wisconsin, the river meets a moraine. The moraine was made during the last ice age. The river enters a beautiful gorge, called the Wisconsin Dells. North of the city of Madison, the river turns to the west. It flows west through the hills of southwest Wisconsin. It joins the Mississippi 15 km south of the city of Prairie du Chien. The river is an important source of hydroelectric power.",
   "Illinois River": "The Illinois River is a river in the United States. It is in the state of Illinois. It is an important tributary of the Mississippi River. The length of the river is about 439 km. The source of the river is in northeastern Illinois, near the city of Joliet. It flows east across Illinois, then southeast. It passes the city of Peoria, the largest city on the river. It flows into southwestern Illinois. It joins the Mississippi River 40 km north of Saint Louis, Missouri. The Illinois river also goes through the northern most edge of Oklahoma. The river was used for transportation by the Native Americans. It was also used by early French trappers. It was an important route between the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes. In the 19th century, a canal was built that connected the river to Lake Michigan. Large ships now use this canal to go from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River. The canal goes through the city of Chicago. It is one of the reasons that Chicago became a big city.",
   "Milk": "Milk is a white liquid produced by mammals, for example cows, dogs, and humans. It is made in the mammary glands (breasts, udders, or teats) of female mammals. Because newborn babies have no teeth, they must be fed milk before they can eat solid food. Milk contains many nutrients to help babies grow and be healthy. Nutrients that milk contains. Milk contains a lot of calcium, which is one of many minerals needed for strong bones and healthy nerves. Milk is very high in Calcium, but relatively low in Magnesium (about 10% of Calcium content). Magnesium is required in higher amounts for proper absorption. Milk also contains fat, protein, and sugar which animals can digest to gain energy. The amounts of things contained in milk is different in different animals. Human milk is thin and has a lot of lactose. Cow milk has less sugar and more fat and protein than human milk. Cow milk has about 3.5% milkfat, 8.5% milk solids and 88% water. The milk of some mammals is collected for humans to drink. It usually comes from cows, but also sometimes goats, yaks and sheep. Some people like to add other flavors to milk before they drink it. Flavored milk is popular with children. Chocolate flavor and sugar is added to milk to make \"chocolate milk\". Chocolate milk is different from milk chocolate -- a type of candy chocolate that contains some milk. Not everyone agrees that milk is healthy for humans to drink. Some research shows that the proteins in milk stop this calcium being useful in adults. One of the largest ever studies, funded by the dairy industry followed the diet of thousands of nurses over 10 years. Those with the highest milk consumption had the highest rates of hip fracture. Cow's milk makes the blood more acidic and therefore the body pulls calcium from the bones to neutralize the acidity in a process called Homeostasis. Some people think milk is good for children. It has been proven in the courts in the US that Cow's milk contains BGH (Bovine Growth Hormones) which are detrimental to human health. In some countries, some people are worried that milk contains chemicals which are fed to cows. These chemicals may be harmful to people. Storing milk. If milk is not kept cool in a refrigerator, it will spoil and become sour after some time. The warmer the milk becomes, the faster it becomes sour. Fermentation makes this happen. Lactic acid bacteria changes the milk sugar into lactic acid. Fermentation is used when making dairy products. Milk is often pasteurised before humans drink it, or is made into dairy products like cream, butter, yoghurt, ice cream, gelato, or cheese. Pasteurised cows' milk will turn sour if it is not kept in a refrigerator. Milk should be stored between 1\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 Celsius. If milk is treated with ultra-high temperatures (UHT), it will last longer before spoiling. This means it does not have to be put in the refrigerator until it is opened. Lactose. Milk contains a chemical called lactose. Babies make an enzyme called lactase inside their bodies. Adults make less lactase. If they do not have enough, they may not be able to digest lactose anymore. This problem is called lactose intolerance and it affects many adults. There are many medicines that help adults digest lactose. Many lactose-intolerant people drink soy milk instead of animal milk, because it does not contain lactose. Soy milk is similar to animal milk, but it is made from soybeans. Coconut milk. Coconut milk looks similar to real milk, but it does not have as many nutrients. It is made by removing the white \"meat\" from a coconut, pressing or squeezing the \"meat\", then adding water. It is sometimes used in cooking, for example, in Thai curry. Coconut cream is a thicker version of coconut milk which contains added sugar.",

The name of the town comes from \"Coq d'Inde\", which is French for \"Turkey\". Around 1900, the area was known as a resort, which is a place people go to on their vacations. The Rolston Hotel brought visitors from all over the region. When it was destroyed by a hurricane, the community fell on hard times. The Ralston Hotel property now belongs to the City Of Bayou La Batre and is a park that is attracting people from other areas who want cool ocean breezes and peace that originally brought visitors. It is nice because it has the gentle sound of the water of Portersville Bay, fishing, and relaxation. Fresh seafood can be found on Shell Belt Road from fishing boats returning to Bayou Coden. Coden is on the southern shore of the mainland, across the Mississippi Sound from Dauphin Island and is one stop along Alabama's Coastal Birding Trail.",
   "Kenya": "Kenya is a country in East Africa. It has the Indian Ocean to its east. It borders Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan, Uganda, and Tanzania. The capital city of Kenya is Nairobi. The first humans may have lived near the lakes of Kenya along the Great Rift Valley, which cuts Kenya from north to south. Kenya's coast is tropical and gets very hot. Inland, it is drier. The highest mountain in Kenya is Mt. Kenya (5,199 m). Many different languages are spoken in Kenya. English is the official language and many people speak Kiswahili. Kiswahili is the National Language. All School going Kenyans are required to learn English. English is the language of instruction in the schools and institutions of higher learning. Kenya was a British colony, but became independent on December 12, 1963. For many years, a single party, the Kenya African National Union (KANU), ruled Kenya. Kenya has been a democratic country but from 1968 to 1992 it was a single party democracy. General elections were held every 5 years however all candidates for election to office had to belong to the ruling party KANU. Mwai Kibaki is currently the president of Kenya and is the first President of Kenya to belong to a party other than KANU. Since he became President he has achieved a lot and Kenya has seen economic growth spurts of up 6%. He however has come under heavy criticism as some feel the reforms that were needed are slow to come. Many Kenyans living in Diaspora have began to return to Kenya as the promise of the future has created a plenty of high paying jobs that are appealing to foreign educated Kenyans. Many people visit Kenya to see the animals such as elephants, zebras, and lions. They also come for the beautiful beaches in the coastal towns of the shore of the Indian Ocean. Tourism is a great foreign exchange earner for Kenya. Education. All Kenyans of school going age are required to attend Primary School which is provided free by the government. The Kenyan school system consist of 8 years of Primary School, Standard 1 through 8, 4 years of High School (Form 1 to 4) and 4 years of University. At the end of Primary school, all students sit for a standardized exam called Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE). The grades attained in this exam determine which High School the student will attend. In Form 4 (this is the last year in High School), students sit for another exam called Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCPE). The highest achieving students are granted admission into the 5 National Universities (Nairobi, Jomo Kenyatta University College of Agriculture and Technology, Kenyatta University, Egerton University and Moi University).",
   "Car": "A car (also called an automobile) is a machine used for travel (a vehicle). Structure. A car has an engine, put together with three or more wheels and a steering wheel. Some have more wheels: big trucks that carry heavy things can have 18 wheels, sometimes even more. Cars come in many shapes and sizes. They usually have a seat for the driver and at least one passenger. Some are also able to carry many passengers. For example, family station wagons carry from 8 to 9 people. Buses can carry even more, but are much bigger. In order for a car to move, it must have fuel, most often gasoline, which is sometimes called petrol. Other common fuels include diesel, natural gas, or electricity. Advantages. Cars are faster than walking and riding a bike, can carry more than one person, and are easy to use. They are used in many countries around the world. Another good thing is that if it's raining heavily it is better to use a car than a bike or walking because driving a car in these conditions can be less dangerous. Disadvantages. If two cars crash they can hurt the people inside or around them. Traffic Jams happen when there are too many cars trying to go the same way. They can create pollution if too many are used in a small area like a city. Many places with many people have public transportation - buses, trains, and subways - that can help many people get to different places very quickly. Carpooling is putting more people in one car to use less fuel and create less pollution.",
   "Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom": "Elizabeth II (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; born 21 April 1926) is the Queen of sixteen independent countries and their territories. She is the queen each country separately, but she lives in the United Kingdom, her oldest \"realm\". Her family has reigned over parts of the United Kingdom for more than a thousand years. She became Queen when her father, King George VI, died on 6 February 1952. She has reigned for 56 years (in 2008) and is the oldest reigning monarch in British history. (The \"longest\" reigning is Queen Victoria: 63 years.) As well as the United Kingdom, Elizabeth II is Queen of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Jamaica, Barbados, the Bahamas, Grenada, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, and Saint Kitts and Nevis. She has a representative (someone to stand-in for her) in each of these countries. Her representative is known as the Governor-General. The 16 countries of which she is Queen are known as Commonwealth realms. Their total population is over 129 million. Elizabeth II holds many other positions. She is the Head of the Commonwealth of Nations, Supreme Governor of the Church of England, Duke of Normandy, Duke of Lancaster, Lord of Mann, and Paramount Chief of Fiji. She is also the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces of many of her realms and Lord Admiral of the United Kingdom. Queen Elizabeth II probably has a huge amount of power, but she does not use it. She has a very good understanding of politics, but she does not tell the government what to do. In the United Kingdom, she is very interested in the running of the nation, and has regular meetings with her government ministers. Since 1947, the Queen has been married to Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Prince Philip was born a prince of Greece and Denmark. Prince Philip became a citizen of the United Kingdom, and used the name Philip Mountbatten. Prince Philip became the Duke of Edinburgh on the day he married, and became a \"Prince of the United Kingdom\" in 1957. The Queen and Prince Philip have four children and eight grandchildren (in 2008). Early life. Elizabeth was born at 17 Bruton Street, in Mayfair, London, on 21 April 1926. She was the oldest child of Prince Albert, Duke of York and Elizabeth, the Duchess of York. Her father was the second son of King George V and brother to the Prince of Wales. No one knew, at that time, that one day he would become King George VI. His wife, the Duchess of York, was the daughter of a Scottish lord. Her name was the Hon. Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. She had grown up in one of Scotland's most famous castles, Glamis Castle. Princess Elizabeth was baptised in the Private Chapel in the grounds of Buckingham Palace (it was destroyed during World War II) by the Archbishop of York. She was named after her mother, while her two middle names are those of her father's grandmother, Queen Alexandra, and her grandmother, Queen Mary. As a child, her family called her \"Lilibet\". She was very fond of her grandfather, George V, and it is said that she helped him recover from a serious illness in 1929. Princess Elizabeth had one sister Princess Margaret, who was born in 1930. The two young princesses were educated at home. They had a governess whose name was Marion Crawford, but was often called \"Crawfie\". The princesses had a special history teacher from Eton College, and a teacher of modern languages. Both princesses learnt to speak French very well. Because the Princess would one day be the Head of the Church of England, she was taught religion by The Archbishop of Canterbury. The Queen has always been a devout member of the Church of England. As a granddaughter of the British sovereign (king), the princess was called \"Her Royal Highness Princess Elizabeth of York\". At the time of her birth, she was third in the line of succession to the throne. This meant that if the king died, then the next in line was her uncle the Prince of Wales and then her father, the Duke of York, and then Princess Elizabeth. But when she was born, there was no reason for people to believe that she would become queen. Everyone thought that one day, her uncle would get married and have children. But even though her uncle married, he and his wife never had children. Her grandfather, King George V, died in 1936. Her uncle became King Edward VIII, but only for a short time. He wanted to marry a woman who was divorced. Because (at that time) this was against the law for the king, he \"abdicated\" (gave up his throne). His brother, the Duke of York, became King George VI. Elizabeth then became the next in line, the \"heir presumptive\" to the throne. (The throne that a ruler sits on, and the crown that they wear are often talked about as symbols for their power.) It was at this time that her grandmother Queen Mary and her mother, who was now called Queen Elizabeth, realised that the Princess's education in history, religion and languages was very important. Queen Mary also gave the Princess lots of good advice on how to behave like a Queen. It was clear that, unless her parents produced a male child, one day Princess Elizabeth would be Queen, not as the wife to a king, but in her own right, like her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria who had reigned for 67 years. When Elizabeth was thirteen years old, the Second World War broke out. Because London was being bombed, the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret were \"evacuated\" (moved to safety) to Windsor Castle in Berkshire. It was suggested that they should be sent to Canada but their mother said: \"The children won't go without me. I won't leave the King. And the King will never leave [England].\" In 1940, Princess Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the BBC's Children's Hour. She spoke to other children who had been evacuated. When she was 13 years old, she first met her future husband, Prince Philip of Greece. She fell in love with him and began writing to him when he was in the Royal Navy. Military career. In 1945, Princess Elizabeth asked her father to let her work for the war effort. She joined the \"Women's Auxiliary Territorial Service\", as \"No 230873 Second Subaltern Elizabeth Windsor\". She trained as a driver, and drove a military truck. She enjoyed training with other young women, and decided to send her own children to school rather than have them educated at home, the way she and her sister were. The Princess Elizabeth was the first, and so far only, female member of the royal family to actually serve in the armed forces, although other royal women have been given honorary ranks. During the Victory celebrations in London, she and her sister, Princess Margaret, went out into the crowd after midnight to celebrate with everyone else. Marriage. Princess Elizabeth married Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on 20 November 1947. The couple are distantly related to each other, through Christian IX of Denmark and Queen Victoria. Prince Philip was not rich, he was Greek Orthodox and his sister had married someone who was thought to be a Nazi, so there were some people who were not happy about the marriage. But most people throughout the Commonwealth were full of joy. Even though people were still very poor because of the war, the royal couple received 2,500 wedding presents from all around the world. Many people helped the Princess save up \"coupons\", so she could buy a beautiful wedding dress. The wedding was held in Westminster Abbey. Princess Margaret was one of the nine bridesmaids. After their wedding, the couple lived mainly at Clarence House in London. For a time, the Duke of Edinburgh was stationed in Malta as a serving Royal Navy officer, so they lived in Malta at a house of Lord Mountbatten of Burma. Although the Royal House is named Windsor, the princes and princess often use the name Mountbatten-Windsor. Succession. In 1951, the King's health became too bad to go to many public events. Princess Elizabeth began to make official visits for him. She visited Greece, Italy and Malta (where Philip was then stationed) during that year. In October, she made a tour of Canada and visited President Harry S Truman in Washington, D.C. In January 1952, Elizabeth and Philip set out for a tour of Australia and New Zealand. They had reached Kenya when a message arrived telling of the death of the King, on 6 February 1952, from lung cancer. Elizabeth and Philip were staying at \"Sagana Lodge\" in Kenya when she was told of her father's death and that now she had succeeded to the throne. It was Prince Philip who broke the news of her father's death to Elizabeth. They returned to the United Kingdom immediately by plane. Elizabeth was proclaimed Queen in Canada first, (an announcement was read to tell the people) on 6 February, 1952. The following day, on February 7 the proclamation was read at St. James's Palace in London. Elizabeth II's coronation (crowning) took place in Westminster Abbey, on 2 June 1953. Her coronation gown, designed by Norman Hartnell, was embroidered with the floral symbols of the countries of the Commonwealth: the Tudor rose of England, the thistle of Scotland, the leek of Wales, the shamrock of Ireland, the wattle of Australia, the maple leaf of Canada, the fern of New Zealand, the protea of South Africa, two lotus flowers for India and Ceylon, and wheat, cotton and jute for Pakistan. Life as Queen. After the Coronation, The Queen and Prince Philip moved into Buckingham Palace, in central London, the main official home of the monarch. But it is believed that, like Queen Victoria, she doesn't like living at the Palace much. She has always thought of Windsor Castle, as her real home. In 1953, the Queen and Prince Philip, set off on a six-month, around the world tour, in the \"Royal Yacht, Britannia\". Elizabeth became the first monarch to \"circumnavigate\" (sail around) the globe. She also became the first reigning monarch to visit Australia, New Zealand and Fiji. Since then, Elizabeth has made many trips. In October 1957, she made a \"state visit\" (an official visit) to the United States, and spoke to the United Nations General Assembly. She then toured Canada, and she became the first monarch to open the nation's Parliament. In February 1961, she visited Ankara in Turkey, and toured India, Iran, Pakistan and Nepal for the first time. Since then the Queen has made state visits to most Commonwealth countries, most European countries and to many countries outside Europe. In 1969, Elizabeth II sent one of 73 Apollo 11 Goodwill Messages to NASA for the historic first lunar landing. The message is etched onto a tiny silicon disc and still rests on the lunar surface today. She greeted the Apollo 11 crew during their tour of the world. In 1991, she became the first British monarch to speak to a joint session of the United States Congress during another state visit to that country. She regularly attends the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings. Elizabeth II is the most widely-travelled head of state in history. Changes to the Commonwealth. When Elizabeth became Queen on 6 February 1952, she was officially Queen of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan and Ceylon (now called Sri Lanka). These were the Commonwealth Countries. There were many more countries that she also ruled, because they belonged to the British Empire. Altogether, she was sovereign of 32 nations. One by one, many of the countries became independent. They now have their own governments. Some of the countries are republics and have a president as \"Head of State\". Some of them are now independent monarchies that still have the Queen as \"Head of State\". Queen Elizabeth II is the only monarch of more than one independent nation. The old British Empire became the Commonwealth of Nations, which includes both monarchies and republics. It is now called \"The Commonwealth\", and the Queen is the Head of the Commonwealth. She works hard to keep peace and good communication between all the nations that are members. The Queen is particularly fond of visiting Canada. She has called Canada her \"home away from home\". She also said \"I am pleased to think that there exists in our Commonwealth a country where I can express myself officially in French,\" and, \"whenever you sing [the French words of] 'O Canada' you are reminded that you come of a proud race.\" The Queen's relationship with her governments and other countries. Ever since she became the Queen, Elizabeth has spent about three hours every day \"doing the boxes\". The \"boxes\" are two large red boxes that are brought to her from the Parliament every day. The are full of state papers sent to her from her various departments, embassies, and government offices. One of the most famous photos taken of Elizabeth as a teenager shows her with her father, the King, learning about \"the boxes\". Because she has been doing this since 1952, she probably knows far more about the government of the UK than anybody else alive. When the Queen is in London, she meets with her Prime Minister once a week, to discuss things that are affecting the nation. One Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher wrote: \"Anyone who imagines that [these meetings] are a mere formality or confined to social niceties is quite wrong; they are quietly business like and Her Majesty brings to bear a formidable grasp of current issues and breadth of experience.\" The Queen also has regular meetings with the First Minister of Scotland and other Ministers of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. She also has meetings with Prime Ministers and Ministers of her other realms, when she is in their country, or when they visit London. She takes a strong interest in the government of her other realms. When Paul Martin, Sr. went to London to discuss the Constitution of Canada, he said later that the Queen knew and understood far more about the Canadian Constitution than any of the British politicians. In the late 1990s, there were \"referendums\" in which the people of Scotland and Wales were asked if they wanted parliaments that were separate from the parliament of the United Kingdom. This was called a \"devolution policy\". As a result, the new Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly of Wales, were set up. The Queen opened the first sessions of these two bodies. In Australia, ever since the states became one country at Federation, there has been a movement for Australia to become a republic, with an elected President as Head of State instead of the Queen. In 1999, the people of Australia were asked in a referendum whether they wanted a republic. The decision of the people was to remain a monarchy. The Queen visited Australia the following year and said that she would continue to serve Australians as she had done for 48 years. The Queen surprised Mary McAleese, who is now President of Ireland, by inviting her to lunch with the Duke of Edinburgh. The Queen wanted to hear the views of a leading Irish Nationalist, about Northern Ireland. Mary McAleese, said that the Queen was \"a dote\" which means \"a really lovely person (in Hiberno-English). Elizabeth II has warm friendly relationships with many world leaders. Her first Prime Minister of Australia, Sir Robert Menzies called her \"my Dear\" and recited a poem that said \"I will love her till I die\". She has friendships with Mary Robinson, President of Ireland (1997-2002) and George W. Bush, who was the first American President in more than 80 years to stay at Buckingham Palace. Nelson Mandela, in the BBC documentary, called her \"my friend, Elizabeth\". In May 2007, the Queen and Prince Philip made a state visit to the United States, in honour of the 400 anniversary of the Jamestown settlement. Faith and Duty. Elizabeth II, as the Monarch of the United Kingdom, is the \"Supreme Governor\" of the Church of England and sworn protector of the Church of Scotland. In fact, although she is very interested in the Church of England, she gives authority to the Archbishop of Canterbury. She sometimes attends the yearly meeting of \"the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland\". The Queen regularly goes to church at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. When she stays at Sandringham House, in Norfolk she goes to St. Mary Magdalene Church. When the Royal Family is holidaying at Balmoral Castle, they go to Crathie Kirk. When the Queen is at Holyroodhouse, which is the Royal Palace in Edinburgh, she goes to Canongate Kirk. The Queen often meets with leaders from other religions as well. In 1980 she became the first British Monarch to visit the Vatican, where she was welcomed by Pope John Paul II. She made another visit twenty years later on October 17, 2000. Queen Elizabeth II is Patron of \"The Council of Christians and Jews\" in the UK. The Queen has shown a very strong sense of duty, ever since she was a girl. The \"Coronation Oath\" that she would serve her people all the days of her life has always been very important to her. Some people think that now that she is old, perhaps she will retire (\"abdicate\") and let her son Prince Charles take the throne. People who know her well, including Prince Charles, have said that this will never happen. Courage. The Queen has often shown her courage, ever since she joined the military at 18, and drove an ambulance in London, while the city was being bombed. During a trip to Ghana in 1961 she was warned that it was dangerous to be near the President Kwame Nkrumah because people wanted to assassinate him. But she refused to be rude to him by keeping away. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Harold Macmillan wrote that the Queen got very impatient with people if they tried to treat her like \"a film star\". In 1964, when the Queen was invited to Quebec, there were fears for her safety. There were suggestions that the tour should be cancelled. But The Queen\u2019s Private Secretary replied that the Queen would be horrified if she was stopped from going to Quebec because of extremists. During the Trooping the Colour in 1981 there was an attempt on the Queen's life. Six rounds of blanks were fired at her from close range as she rode her horse down The Mall. Her only reaction was to duck slightly and then continue on. In 1982 there was a surprising incident when a man called Michael Fagan successfully broke into Buckingham Palace in the morning, while the Queen's Police Guard was walking the dogs. He set off an alarm but one of the staff turned it off, because they thought it was faulty. Michael Fagan then wandered around, drank a bottle of wine and cut his hand on a broken ashtray. When he found the Queen's bedroom he woke her up, and sat on the end of the bed, to tell her his problems. The Queen kept quite calm. She got up to get him some cigarettes and was able to call a large \"footman\" (a servant) who held onto the man until the guards came. Michael Fagan was charged with stealing the wine. Family relations. Throughout her long reign, Queen Elizabeth II has been supported in her many official duties by her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Prince Philip made an Oath of Allegiance to the Queen on the day of her Coronation. The Queen has also had the support of her mother Queen Elizabeth, known as \"The Queen Mother\", who lived to be 101 years old, and stayed very active in her old-age. The Queen is the patron of many organisations and charities. She has many invitations and official duties. Many of the duties have been shared by other members of the Royal Family, who have also become patrons of many organisations. Among the hard-working Royals are her son Charles, Prince of Wales and her daughter, Anne, the Princess Royal, as well as the Queen's cousins, the Duke of Kent, the Duke of Gloucester, Prince Michael of Kent and Princess Alexandra. The Queen has had a lot of sadness over the broken marriages and divorces of three of her children, Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Prince Andrew. Prince Charles, to avoid scandal, and because of the position he would one day hold in the Church of England, had difficulty finding a wife who would be acceptable. His marriage to Lady Diana Spencer was thought of as a fairytale wedding because she was young, innocent and beautiful. But it soon became unhappy, and ended in divorce, and in the terrible tragedy of her death in 1997. In the year 2002, within a few months of each other, the Queen's mother and sister Princess Margaret both died. On April 9, 2005, Prince Charles married Camilla Parker-Bowles, whom he had loved for very many years. Their marriage was a \"civil ceremony\" in the Guildhall at Windsor, which the Queen did not attend. Some people thought that this was a sign that she did not approve. But the marriage was followed by a religious ceremony in St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, which the Queen and all the Royal Family attended. Of the younger members of the family, it is said that the Queen is very close to her daughter-in-law, Sophie, Countess of Wessex, wife of the Queen's youngest son, Prince Edward. The Queen has a good relationship with all her grandchildren but particularly Prince William, Princess Beatrice and Zara Phillips. As the Queen has got older, people have sometimes worried about her health. When she appeared with a plaster on her arm, there was a rumour that she was sick, and needed \"intravenous\" treatment. But in fact, she had been bitten while stopping her dogs from fighting. The Queen is very rarely sick, but lately, has had some problems with her back. Since her 80th birthday, the Queen is leaving more duties to the younger members of the Royal Family, particularly to Prince Charles, who will one day follow her as the reigning monarch. Silver Jubilee. In 1977, the Queen celebrated her Silver Jubilee, marking the 25 anniversary of her coming to the Throne. There was a royal procession in the golden State Coach and a service of thanksgiving at St. Paul's Cathedral. Millions of people watched on television. There were public \"street parties\" held across the UK. Five commemorative stamps were also printed. The Jubilee line of the London Underground, which opened in 1979, was named in honour of the anniversary. Golden Jubilee. In 2002, Elizabeth II celebrated her Golden Jubilee, marking the 50 anniversary of her coming to the Throne. The Queen made a tour of the Commonwealth realms. There was the first ever pop concert in the gardens of Buckingham Palace, and a service of thanksgiving at St. Paul's Cathedral. The celebrations were not so big as 25 years earlier, because the Queen's mother and sister had both died that year. Diamond Wedding Anniversary. The Queen and Prince Philip celebrated their sixtieth (Diamond) wedding anniversary on Monday 19 November 2007, with a special service at Westminster Abbey. The night before, Prince Charles gave a private dinner party at Clarence House for twenty members of the Royal Family. On the following day, 20 November, The Queen and Prince Philip went off on a visit to Malta, where they had stayed from 1949 to 1951 after getting married. A Royal Navy ship which was nearby, got its sailors to line up on deck, to form a big number '60', for the couple's sixtieth wedding anniversary. Wealth. People often wonder how rich the Queen really is. It is very hard to tell. The reason for this is because she owns several large properties, such as Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle which have never been valued. She also owns a fabulous collection of works of art, which she \"holds in trust\". This means that she cannot sell them. They belong to \"the Crown\" but not to Elizabeth as a person. The artworks and the properties are worth billions of dollars. In 2006, \"Forbes\" magazine published an estimate of her personal fortune. They guessed (on evidence) that it was about US$500 million (\u00a3280 million). At the time of the Tsunami disaster of December 26, 2004, it was said that Queen Elizabeth II gave more from her private money, than any other person. However, she did not give the money to the governments of the countries. She gave it to many charities such as the Save the Children Fund. List of the countries of the Commonwealth Realm. The Queen has a coat of arms in each of her Realms. In the UK, they are known as the \"Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom\". Every British monarch has used these arms since the reign of Queen Victoria.There is a separate \"Royal Coat of Arms\" for use in Scotland, which shows the insignia of the Order of the Thistle.",

These two skyscrapers, the North Tower and the South Tower, were once the tallest buildings in the world. They had 110 floors each. The Twin Towers and the WTC building 7 were destroyed in the September 11, 2001 attacks while the other buildings were damaged beyond repair.

   "Netherlands": "The Netherlands is a country in Europe. More than 16 million people live there. To the north and west of the Netherlands lies the North Sea. To the east is the country Germany and to the south is the country Belgium. The Netherlands is one of the countries that started the European Union. People who live in the Netherlands are called \"Dutch. The language of the Netherlands is also called Dutch Name. \"The Netherlands\" means \"the low lands\". The land is very flat, and only rises a little bit above the sea level. One third of the land is below sea level. The Netherlands is also sometimes mistaken to be Holland. Holland was a very rich area in the western part of the Netherlands, thus causing people to be mistaken. Some people who do not live in the western part of the Netherlands do not like it when people call the country Holland. Holland means \"wooded land\" because the Holland area used to be covered with forests. History. At the end of the Middle Ages the dukes of Burgundy, a country that is now part of France, united seventeen areas. Those areas were called the Netherlands. When the daughter of a duke married the king of Spain, the Netherlands became part of Spain. In the 16th century many Dutch people became Protestant. The king of Spain did not like it, he wanted all Dutch to be Roman Catholic. He decided that all Protestants should be killed. Of course the Dutch people did not like this, and in 1568 they started a war against Spain. The war lasted until 1648, therefore it is called the Eighty Years' War. An important leader of the Dutch in this war was William the Silent. In 1648 the Netherlands and Spain signed peace. The Dutch people were allowed to keep all the areas they conquered. The part of the Netherlands that was not conquered by the Dutch stayed part of Spain. Later this part became the country Belgium. When the Netherlands became independent, it was a very special country. That time almost all countries in Europe were ruled by a king, but the Netherlands was not. The Netherlands was made up of seven provinces, that were ruled by civilians. Together those provinces were ruled by a stadtholder, but he did not have much power. In the 17th century the Netherlands was the richest and one of the most powerful countries in the world. Therefore the Dutch call the 17th century the Golden Age. They had possessions all around the world. The most important possession were the East Indies, a country that is now called Indonesia. The Dutch also founded the city New York, but they called it New Amsterdam. In 1628 they sold it for 60 gilder. The Netherlands often fought wars against other European countries, especially against England. Michiel de Ruyter, a Dutch admiral, became a Dutch hero when he defeated the English navy close to London. In the 18th century the Netherlands became poorer. Many people thought this was the fault of the stadtholders. Many thought they had too much power and wanted them to get away. In 1789 the French people deposed their king. French armies attacked other countries to depose their leaders too. In 1795 they attacked the Netherlands. Stadtholder William V had to flee to England. The Netherlands were renamed to Batavian Republic and became a democracy. But the French were not content with the Dutch ruler, so in 1806 the French emperor Napoleon made his brother Louis Bonaparte king of the Netherlands. Louis became popular in the Netherlands, but the emperor was again not content with him, so in 1810 the Netherlands became a part of France. In 1815 Napoleon was defeated, and the Netherlands became independent again. The rulers of European countries thought it was a good idea to make the Netherlands stronger, to make them able to resist another French invasion. Therefore Belgium and Luxembourg were added to the Netherlands. William I, the son of stadtholder William V, became king. The Belgians were not happy with the Dutch king. In 1830 they revolted. William sent an army, but it was defeated by the Belgians. In 1831 the Belgians chose their own king, and Belgium became an independent country. Some people thought the Dutch king had too much power. They wanted to give him less power and vote for the government themselves. In 1848 there were violent revolts against the kings of many European countries. The Dutch king was afraid the same would happen in the Netherlands. Therefore he allowed Johan Rudolf Thorbecke to write a constitution. From then on people were allowed to vote. At first only rich men were allowed to vote. From 1919 on everyone was allowed to vote. In World War I, the Netherlands did not fight. The Dutch wanted to stay neutral in World War II as well, but in 1940 the country was invaded and occupied by Germany. Just like in other countries they had occupied, the Germans started to kill Jews. Anne Frank was a Jewish girl who lived in the Netherlands. She died in a German concentration camp. When she and her family were hiding for the Germans, she wrote a diary. After the war her diary became very famous. In 1944 the American, Canadian, Polish and British armies liberated the south of the Netherlands from the Germans. They wanted to cross the Rhine river to liberate the rest of the country, but they were defeated by the Germans. It took until May 1945 before the entire country was liberated. During the five years of German occupation, 250,000 people had died in the Netherlands. Shortly after the war, Indonesia declared its independence. The Dutch sent soldiers to Indonesia. During the war the Dutch realized how it is to be occupied by another country, so some people thought the Dutch should not do the same to the Indonesians. After other countries, including the United States, told the Dutch to leave Indonesia, they finally did so (1949). After the war the Netherlands became one of the richest countries in the world. In 2004 the United Nations said the Netherlands were the 5th best country to live in. Politics. The Netherlands is a constitutional monarchy. That means the country has a king or queen, but the real power is in hands of a parliament, chosen by the Dutch people. All Dutch people who are 18 or older are allowed to vote. There are elections every four years. After the elections, parties that have had a majority of the votes create a cabinet. The cabinet consists of a prime minister and several other ministers. The Netherlands is known for tolerance in politics. The Netherlands is the only country where soft drugs are not entirely considered illegal. Furthermore the Netherlands is one of the few countries that allow same-sex marriages, euthanasia and prostitution to a certain extent. Provinces. Apart from these provinces the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba are also part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Geography. In fact a large part of Holland was created by the sand that came from the many rivers flowing through it. Notable Dutch rivers are the Rhine, the Maas, the IJssel and the Scelt. A large part of the Netherlands is below sea level. This is because the Dutch have made many lakes and parts of the sea dry, creating polders. Therefore there is a saying in the Netherlands \"God created the earth, except the Netherlands. Because the Netherlands were created by the Dutch themselves.\" This makes the Netherlands very flat. In the very south-east of the Netherlands, in Limburg, there are some hills. Therefore, this region is a tourist-attraction for many Dutch people. The highest point in the Netherlands, the Vaalserberg, is 321 metres above sea level. People. The Netherlands is a small country, but many people live there. It is one of the most densely populated countries of the world. Most people in the Netherlands speak Dutch. In Friesland about 200,000 people speak Frisian. Frisian is the language with the most similarities to English. Some Dutch people speak dialects. The Saxon dialects spoken in the north eastern part of the Netherlands are somewhat similar to Lower German. According to a survey done in 2006, 25% of the Dutch people are Christian and 3% believe in an other organised religion, like Judaism, Islam or Hinduism etc. 26% are 'unbounded spiritual' (have their own beliefs and are not tied to a religion). The other 44% are not religious.",

   "Portugal": "Portugal is a country in the south-west of Europe. The Atlantic Ocean is to the west and south, and Spain is to the north and east. Compared to the countries near Portugal, Portugal is actually quite smaller. Three groups of islands in the Atlantic Ocean are also part of Portugal: the Azores (\"A\u00e7ores\"), the Madeira and the Savage Isles (\"Ilhas Selvagens\"). The Savage Isles are a small group of islands with nobody on them, controlled by Madeira. The country says that Oliven\u00e7a is also part of it, but it is controlled by Spain (even the United Nations do not recognize the occupation). History. Portugal became its own kingdom in 1139. The border with Spain has been almost the same since the 13th century. Fishing and trade with other countries are some of the most important economic activities. Portugal was important in world exploration for two reasons. Henry the Navigator, a prince from Portugal, was very interested in exploration. Inventions in navigation led to a bigger knowledge of geography. Portugal was a world power during the 15th and 16th centuries. However, it lost a lot of money soon after this. The city of Lisbon was destroyed in an earthquake in 1755. The country was occupied during the Napoleonic Wars. It lost its colony, Brazil, in 1822. In 1910, Portugal became a Republic, and in 1926, a military group took control of the country from the Portuguese 1st Republic. This began a time of rule by fascist governments. This lasted until 1974. That year, a peaceful left-wing army coup, called the \"Carnation Revolution\" happened. The coup changed how the country was run. The next year, Portugal allowed its colonies in Africa to be on their own: Mozambique, Angola, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe.

The first European people to come to South Africa were Portuguese explorers. In 1487, Bartolomeu Dias discovered the Cape of Good Hope. Dias wanted to call it \"Cape of Storms\", but the King of Portugal changed it to \"Cape of Good Hope\". He called it this because it gave them a new chance to find a sea route to India. In 1652 Jan van Riebeeck colonized the Cape by starting a refresh station. He started the camp for the Dutch East India Company so that they could give fresh food to ships on their way to the south of Asia. Since there were very few native people living in the Cape, slaves were brought from Indonesia, Madagascar and India to work at the Colony. In 1795 Great Britain took the Cape from the Dutch East India Company because it wanted to stop France from taking it. It was given back to them in 1803 but was then annexed in 1807 when the Dutch East India Company went bankrupt. Diamonds were discovered in South Africa in 1867 and gold was discovered in 1884. This caused many people to come to South Africa from Europe hoping to make money. Not only was there gold and diamonds to find but people were needed to run shops, build houses and do many other jobs. The First Boer War happened in 1800-1881. The war was between the British, who controlled the Cape, and the Boer Republics. The Boer Republics were established when Dutch settlers moved north in the Great Trek.The British soldiers and their commanders underestimated the Boers and lost the war. They returned 8 years later in 1899 and won the war in 1902. The British brought many more soldiers this time, and the Boers had no chance of winning. At this time, the British made use of concentration camps which demoralized the Boers and helped the British stop the war from lasting any longer. on May 31, 1910 the Union of South Africa was created from the Cape and Natal colonies, as well as the Orange Free State and the Transvaal, the two Boer Republics. Economy. South Africa's economy is split between First World and Third World standards. The developed part of the economy is similar to that of most wealthy nations, such as Britain or Australia. The rest of the economy is closer to that of poor nations, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo or rural India. The main industries in South Africa are mining (mostly gold and diamonds), car making, and service industries, such as insurance. Military. South Africa's military is the most powerful in southern Africa. South Africa spends more on its military than any of its neighbors, and as a result it has very advanced weapons.

When the last thing in a group it pointed to, that number is the quantity of the group. Measuring. Measuring is done with a ruler or a machine. We put a ruler next to a thing to measure how long it is. We put things on a scale to measure their mass. Other machines are used to measure temperature, speed, or electricity. Decimal numbers. When measuring things, a whole number might not be the best answer. A distance might be longer than 5 meters, but less than 6 meters. Meter sticks are marked off in parts of a meter. Decimals are formed by marking off a ruler in ten equal parts. Each part is a tenth. 5.2 meters is a little bit longer than 5 meters. 5.7 meters is a little bit shorter than 6 meters. Each of these tenths can be marked with ten smaller parts. The one hundred centimeters on a meter stick are done this way. Fraction numbers. Fractions are used when there are parts of a whole number. The dial on a machine may be marked with four parts between each whole number. A scale with a bag of potatoes may show five and three fourths kilograms. This would be almost six kilograms. The words \"amount\" and \"number\". People often use the word \"amount\" when they should say \"number\". The word \"number\" should be used if a particular number could be put: e.g.",
   "Mohandas Gandhi": "Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (Devanagari: \u092e\u094b\u0939\u0928\u0926\u093e\u0938 \u0915\u0930\u092e\u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926 \u0917\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0940; Gujarati: \u0aae\u0acb\u0ab9\u0aa8\u0aa6\u0abe\u0ab8 \u0a95\u0ab0\u0aae\u0a9a\u0a82\u0aa6 \u0a97\u0abe\u0a82\u0aa7\u0ac0:October 2 1869 - January 30 1948) was a famous spiritual leader and politician from India, the \"Father of the Nation\". He is also known popularly as \"Mahatma\" Gandhi. \"Mahatma\" means \"great soul\" in the Indian language Sanskrit. Now he is the Martyr of the Nation since 1948. During Gandhi's life, many countries were colonies of the United Kingdom. Many of these countries wanted independence from the United Kingdom. Gandhi was one of the most important people involved in the movement for the independence of India. He was a non-violent activist, who led the independence movement through non-violent protest. Life sketch. Gandhi was born October 2, 1869 in the state of Gujarat in India. Several members of his family worked for the government of the state. When Gandhi was older, he went to England for a few years to study law. After he became a lawyer, he went to the British colony of South Africa where he experienced apartheid, laws that said people with dark skin had fewer rights than people with light skin. He decided then to become a political activist, so he could help change these unfair laws. He created a powerful, non-violent movement. When he returned to India, he helped cause India's independence from British rule, inspiring other colonial peoples to work for their own independence, break up the British Empire, and replace it with the Commonwealth. People of many different religions and ethnic groups lived in British India. Many people thought that the country should break into separate countries so that different groups could have their own countries. In particular, many people thought that Hindus and Muslims should have separate countries. Gandhi was a Hindu, but he liked ideas from many religions including Islam, Judaism and Christianity, and he thought that people of all religions should have the same rights, and could live together peacefully in the same country. He said, \"God has no religion.\" In 1947, British India 'Empire' became independent, and broke into two different countries, India and Pakistan. Gandhi wanted independence, but didn't want the split into two different countries. Instead of celebrating on independence day, he was mourning the division of India. Gandhi's principle of \"satyagraha\", often translated as \"way of truth\" or \"pursuit of truth\", has inspired other democratic and anti-racist activists like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Nelson Mandela. Gandhi often said that his values were simple, based upon traditional Hindu beliefs: truth (\"satya\"), and non-violence (\"ahimsa\"). On January 30, 1948, Gandhi was killed by a extremist Hindu activist, Nathuram Godse, who was angry because he felt that Gandhi was too lenient towards Muslims.",
   "Need": "A need is a thing that a living being, plant or animal, must have to live or to be happy. A thing that someone would like to have, but just needs enough, is called a want. Every person has the same basic needs for the body. Humans have boldily needs of water, food, clothing, and shelter to live. The need for water is the most important because a person will die very quickly without drinking water. In a warm place food is the next most important need. In a cold place, the need for clothes or shelter may be next most important because a person will soon die without these. Other human needs are not so certain. They are mostly needs for the mind. It is often said that a person needs love, family, and friends. These needs are for personal relationships. They may also be wants. It is true that a life may be better with these things, but some friends can be bad, or bad sometimes. Good relationships can make life very happy. Thinking about a need that is not possible can make a person very unhappy. Some of the study of philosophy is about questions like \"What are the needs of a human?\" The word philosophy is from Greek, meaning the \"love of wisdom\". Some scientists study the needs of human or animal minds and bodies. The study of the mind is called psychology - \"words about the mind\". The study of bodily needs is part of medicine.",

About 300 million people speak French as a native or a second language. Like most Romance languages, its nouns have genders that are divided into male (masculin) and female (f\u00e9minin) words. History. In ancient times, the Celts lived in what is now France. In those days, the land was called Gaul (Gallia). The Romans spread their power to Gallia and made Gallia their provinces. Because the Romans spoke Latin, the local people learned Latin and began to speak it. Their own language, Gaulish, tended to be spoken less often, although Breton is a language still spoken today in the part of France called Brittany, that came from the old Celtic language. After the Roman Empire fell and Germanic peoples swarmed the countryside, Latin was changing quickly; and in medieval France it changed into two accents or languages: \"langue d'oc\" and \"langue d'o\u00efl\". They both mean \"language of yes\", because \"oc\" was the word for \"yes\" in the south, and \"o\u00efl\" meant \"yes\" in the north. Today, the word for yes in French is \"oui\", pronounced like \"we\". \"Langue d'oc\" is now called Occitan, and it is still spoken by many people in Southern France.",

   "Ice": "Water becomes ice when it is very cold. Liquid water freezes and becomes solid ice at a temperature of 0\u00b0 Celsius (32\u00b0 Fahrenheit or 273 kelvin). Ice is the common name for frozen water. Other liquids (say ammonia or methane or milk) could be called ice when they freeze but we would always say 'milk ice', for instance, instead of just 'ice'. Places like Antarctica have lots of ice, but people can also find it in home appliances (machines in the home) like the refrigerator or freezer. If people put water in a freezer and leave it for a while, the water gets very cold and will freeze solid, creating ice. People can put water into a copper (or metal) container if they want ice to freeze faster. Copper is a very good conductor of heat--it can freeze water faster than a regular (plastic) ice tray would be able to. Surprisingly, an open tray of hot water can freeze faster than the same amount of cold water! This happens because enough of the hot water can evaporate before cooling, reducing the amount of water to be frozen. Unlike other liquids, water expands as it freezes to become ice; so ice floats on water because ice has less density than water. This is very unusual - just about every other liquid gets more dense as it cools; water ice, however, is an important exception. Liquid water expands by about 9% as it becomes ice - it takes up more space. If water in pipes freezes it can burst the pipe. Water in glass bottles can explode in the freezer if people leave it there long enough to freeze. Water freezing in rock crevices can expand enough to split hard rocks apart; this is an important geological weathering process that can wear down mountains and make rock into soil. Salt water needs a lower temperature to freeze than pure water. The resulting ice contains much less salt than the salt water it came from. This salty ice is not as strong as frozen pure water. Similarly spreading salt on ice melts it: the salt progressively eats into the ice, forming salty water which is not cold enough to be frozen at the same temperature. Because ice floats, even large bodies of water that freeze, like some oceans, only form ice on the surface. Most lakes never freeze to the bottom. Even the coldest oceans, say in the Arctic, only freeze on the top, leaving liquid ocean circulating below. Because of this the Earth's oceans are able to redistribute heat and the climate of the earth has less extremes of heat and cold than it would otherwise. If ice were to sink instead of float, the oceans would fill up with ice from the bottom, would remain solid and only some of the top would thaw. A solid ocean would not circulate heat. But because ice floats on the surface the water beneath can continue to circulate and the ice on the surfce stays exposed and readily melts when the temperature rises. The earth's climate is always changing. When it is very cold it's called an ice age. The most recent ice age finished only ten thousand years ago. During ice ages very large areas of the earth are covered in ice, snow and glaciers. The causes of ice ages are complex, or hard to understand. Global warming is currently affecting the earth's ice resources and its causes are also very complex. When materials are cooled their molecules vibrate less and compact together. When most materials reach a temperature called the freezing point, the molecules form a crystalline solid - although some materials (like glass and tar) do not crystallise at all but form super stiff fluids, which seem to be solid. Only Helium will not freeze; all other substances will freeze if cold enough, but fluids like cooking oil, anti-freeze, petrol (gasoline), nitrogen, etc. freeze at temperatures that most people will rarely, if ever, experience. Dry ice. There is also 'dry ice'; it is frozen carbon dioxide. Dry ice exposed to normal air gives off carbon dioxide gas that is odorless and colorless. The gas is so cold that when it mixes with air it cools the water vapour in the air to fog, which looks like a thick white smoke. It is often used in the theatre to create the appearance of fog or smoke.",
   "Travel": "Travel is the activity going from one place to another location. When a person makes the same trip every day to work or school, this type of travelling is usually called \"commuting.\" Some people travel to other cities as part of their job. This is called \"business travel.\" Some people travel on their vacation, to visit other towns, cities, or countries. These people stay overnight in hotels, hostels, motels, apartments or bed and breakfast or perhaps in a tent - then they are campers. Some people write about traveling in books called autobiographies or journals.",
   "Blackboard": "A blackboard, also called a chalkboard, is a surface on which markings made with chalk are visible. It is used as a surface to write on. Blackboards are often used to help teach in school. Blackboards are not used as much now. People use whiteboards instead. Whiteboards are used because some people are allergic to the dust the chalk used to write on chalkboards generate, and because the dust is hard to clean up when spilled. Chalkboards are written on with chalk, which is actually not the stone chalk at all. It is actually made by factories. Schoolteachers often use the chalkboard to display things at large. Chalkboards can be black or dark green, also called blackboards and greenboards.",
   "Download": "Download means getting information from another computer or server. The opposite of downloading is uploading, which is sending data to another computer. Usually we do not say \"download\" for a single web page (for example when you open this page on your computer). When we say we downloaded something, it is normally a bigger piece of information, like data or a computer program. The word downloadable means the ability to get information or data from a primary source for one's use. The source is expected to be authentic and patent. At the user's end, the downloaded information or data are to be used based on agreement notice. In the 21st century, it is very easy to download information from the internet. Many people make the mistake of downloading illegal files from the internet.",
   "GNOME": "GNOME is a computer desktop environment. It was designed for GNU/Linux, but many other operating systems can use it too. GNOME aims to provide an easy way to use a computer. GNOME is a free software project. It was made because people were questioning whether KDE is free. Some people think that GNOME is better than KDE because it is more easy to use GNOME compared to KDE. But, some people also think that KDE is better than GNOME because KDE looks better. GNOME is part of the GNU project.",
   "Arctic": "The Arctic is the area around the Earth's North Pole. The Arctic includes parts of Russia, Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Lapland and Svalbard as well as the Arctic Ocean. It is technically an ocean, but it is always frozen, so it is solid ice. During summer, the Sun never sets in the Arctic. This is because during summer there, the North Pole points toward the Sun. So, sometimes people call it the Land of the Midnight Sun. The word comes from the Greek word \"\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2\", meaning \"bear\". The North Pole aims at the stars called the Great Bear and the Little Bear. This is why it is called the Arctic.",
   "Sin": "A sin is something that a religion tells its believers is a bad thing to do. Religions that believe in God usually say that God told them that some things are sins. Usually the sacred books of a religion talk about sins. There are some things that most religions agree are sins. For example, almost every religion agrees that it is wrong to kill people (murder). There are other things that are sins in only a few religions. For example, Muslims and Jews say that it is wrong to eat pork, but other religions do not think that it's wrong to eat this. Some people are not religious. They say that people should try to do the things that help other people, and not to do the things that hurt other people. People who are not religious do not usually say that the things that hurt other people are \"sins\", but sometimes they use this word for these things. Most religions describe \"sins\" as actions that break their rules.",
   "Electronics": "Electronics is the study and use of electrical components and circuits to achieve a design goal. The main parts, or electronic components, used in electronics are resistors, capacitors, coils of wire called inductors, integrated circuits, connection wires, and circuit boards. Older electronics used glass or metal vacuum tubes to control the flow of electrons. By the late 1960's and early 1970's the transistor, a semiconductor, began replacing vacuum tubes as control parts. At about the same time, integrated circuits (miniature semiconductor circuits containing large numbers of very small transistors put on on very thin slices of silicon) came into general use. Integrated circuits not only made it possible to significantly reduce the number of components needed to make electronic products, but also made them much more reliable and at a lower cost. People interested in physics often study how and why these electronic components work. By their studies they are able to discover, invent, or improve electronic components. Other people design and construct electronic circuits, using these components, to solve practical problems. These people are a part of electrical, electronics and computer engineering field. Take as an example a television set. A television set's input is a broadcast signal received from an antenna, or a wire cable provided by a cable television vendor. Signal processing circuits inside the television set use the brightness, colour, and sound information contained in the received signal to control the television set's output devices. The display output device may be a cathode ray tube (CRT) or a plasma or liquid crystal display screen. The audio output device might be a magnetically driven audio speaker. The display output devices convert the signal processing circuits' brightness and colour information into the visible image displayed on a screen. The audio output device converts the processed sound information into sounds that can be heard by listeners. Analysis of a circuit/network involves knowing the input and the signal processing circuit, and finding out the output. Knowing the input and output and finding out or designing the signal processing part is called as synthesis. Analog circuits. Analog circuits are used for signals that have a range of amplitudes. \u00a0In general, analog circuits measure or control the amplitude of signals. \u00a0In the early days of electronics, all electronic devices used analog circuits for signal processing and control. Pulse circuits. Pulse circuits are used for signals that require rapid pulses of energy. \u00a0For example, aircraft and ground radar equipment work by using pulse circuits to create and send high powered bursts of radio energy from radar transmitters. \u00a0Special antennas (called \"beam\" or \"dish\" antennas because of their shape) are used to send (\"transmit\") the high powered bursts in the direction the beam or dish antenna is pointed. The radar transmitter's pulses or bursts of radio energy hit and bounce back (they are \"reflected\") from hard and metallic objects. \u00a0Hard objects are things like buildings, hills, and mountains. \u00a0Metallic objects are anything made of metal, like aircraft, bridges, satellites, or even objects in space. \u00a0The reflected radar energy is detected by radar pulse receivers which use both pulse and digital circuits together. \u00a0The pulse and digital circuits in radar pulse receivers are used to show the location and distance of objects which have reflected the radar transmitter's high powered pulses. By controlling how often the rapid pulses of radar energy are sent out by a radar transmitter (called the transmitter's \"pulse timing\"), and how long it takes for the reflected pulse energy to come back to the radar receiver, one can tell not only where objects are, but also how far away they are. \u00a0 Digital circuits in a radar receiver calculate the distance to an object by knowing the time interval between energy pulses. \u00a0\u00a0The radar receiver's digital circuits count how long it takes between pulses for an object's reflected energy to be detected by the radar receiver. \u00a0Since radar pulses are sent and received at approximately the speed of light, the distance to an object can easily be calculated. \u00a0This is done in digital circuits by dividing the speed of light by the time it takes to receive the radar energy reflected back from an object. The time between pulses (often called \"pulse rate time\", or PRT) sets the limit on how far away an object can be detected. \u00a0That distance is called the \"range\" of a radar transmitter and receiver. \u00a0Radar transmitters and receivers use long PRT's to find the distance to objects that are far away. \u00a0Long PRT's makes it possible to accurately determine the distance to the moon, for example. \u00a0Fast PRT's are used to detect objects that are much closer, like ships at sea, high flying aircraft, or to determine the speed of fast moving automobiles on highways. Digital circuits. Digital circuits are used for signals that repeatedly turn on and off. \u00a0Active components in digital circuits typically have a constant amplitude when turned on, and zero amplitude when turned off. \u00a0In general, digital circuits count the number of times a component is switched on and off. \u00a0Computers and electronic clocks are examples of electronic devices that are made up of mostly digital circuits.",
   "Fire Brigades Union": "The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) is the main union for firefighters in the United Kingdom. A union is a group of workers. They make the group to improve pay and working conditions. It was founded in 1918 in the London area as the \"Firemans Trade Union\". It soon grew to cover the entire country. Today, it has around 50,000 members.",
   "Wheel": "A wheel is a disc- or circle-shaped mechanical device. Its main purpose is to allow things to \"roll\"; in other words, the wheel spins, and objects on the wheels move more easily along the ground. It is a simple machine. History. Most experts believe the ancient Mesopotamians invented the wheel about 4000 BC. In addition, the Chinese discovered it on their own around 2800 BC. The Inca and Maya had wheels on children's toys around 1500 BC, but they did not use wheels for work. Africa south of the Sahara desert and Australia did not have the wheel until people there met people from other cultures.",
   "Exercise": "Physical exercise. Exercise can be an important part of physical therapy, weight loss, or sports performance. Exercise can be fun, but it is important for the exercisor to do what he likes and eat enough calories, so when he exercises he is building up muscles, not just breaking them down for fuel. Carbohydrates are muscle-sparing; and if one does not get enough calories overall, there is the risk of burning muscles up with the fat to make up the deficit. Exercise benefits. Regular exercise has been shown to help high blood pressure, obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and depression, among others.",
   "Writing": "Writing is the act of recording information on a medium so that it may be read by others or at a later time. The medium is usually paper, though other permanent media, such as cloth and clay can be used. Temporary media such as television and movie screens can also be used to display writing. Writing is often done using a hand tool such as a pencil, a pen, or a brush, but more and more, text is being created by computer printers under the control of a computer application. In the earliest times, writing was usually a set of pictures, which stood for words or ideas. The Egyptians used this kind of method in their invention of hieroglyphs. Chinese use the same idea today, where a character stands for a thing rather than a sound. A people known as the Sumerians, who lived in a part of the world now occupied by Iraq and its neighbors, developed a form of writing called cuneiform. Marks pressed into soft clay stood for sounds; after the clay had dried, it could be carried elsewhere for others to read. Cuneiform was also used to create messages on soft rock, leather, and papyrus. About 4000 years ago, the first alphabet began to appear. It is only in the last few hundred years that most people have been able to write and to read. Until then, education was only for the wealthy or powerful, and because each book had to be created by hand, there were very few books available compared to the billions in the world today.",
   "Plato": "Plato was a very important classical Greek philosopher. He lived from 427 BC to 347 BC. He was a student of Socrates and the teacher of Aristotle. Plato wrote about many ideas in philosophy that are still talked about today. In fact, one modern philosopher (Alfred North Whitehead) said that all philosophy since Plato was just comments on his works. Plato wrote his books in the form of dialogues -- people talking about ideas, and sometimes disagreeing about them. This makes Plato's books more interesting to read. Socrates is usually the main person in Plato's dialogues. Usually, Socrates talks with people about their ideas, and tries to see if they believe anything that is illogical. Other people in the stories often become angry with Socrates because of this! People who study Plato argue about whether Socrates really said the same things that Plato makes him say, or whether Plato just used Socrates as a character, to make the ideas he was talking about seem more important. One of Plato's most famous works is \"The Republic\" (In Greek, \"Politeia,\" or 'city'). In that work, he describes Socrates's vision of an \"ideal\" state. The method of questioning in this dialogue, called the Socratic method, is as important as the content. The Republic contains ideas of Socrates: \"Socrates said it, Plato wrote it.\" Works by Plato. We have many dialogues that were supposed to be written by Plato. But because he was such a famous philosopher, some later philosophers said that their works were really written by him, to make their works seem more important. In the list on this page, a work is marked (1) if scholars are not sure that Plato really wrote it, and it is marked (2) if scholars generally agree that Plato did \"not\" really write it.",
   "Sundial": "A sundial shows the current solar time during the day. It does this because the sun appears to move through the sky. At different times in the day when the sun is shining, a shadow is cast in different places on the dial. A person marks the dial with the time at a certain shadow. This lets users easily see the time. There are a few commonly seen designs, such as the 'ordinary' or standard garden sundial. However, sundials can be designed for any surface where a fixed object casts a predictable shadow. Ancient Egypt had sundials. Other cultures developed them further, including the Greeks and Romans.",
   "Peninsula": "A peninsula is a region of land that sticks out in a body of water. It is also defined as a piece of land with water on three sides. Korea, and most of the U.S. state of Florida, are peninsulas. If Eurasia is considered a continent then the continent of Europe is technically a peninsula.",
   "Nim": "There is a simple mathematical strategy to play the game perfectly. If both players play perfectly, the winner is determined by the initial setup.",
   "Blue": "Blue is one of the colors of the rainbow that people can see. It is one of the three traditional primary colors, along with red and yellow. It has the shortest wavelength of these colors (about 470 nanometers). Blue is the color of the earth's sky and sea. Earth looks blue when viewed from outer space by astronauts. Blue is the color of a \"bluebird\". Meaning of blue. Blue is often associated with depth and stability. It symbolizes trust, loyalty, wisdom, confidence, intelligence, faith, truth, and heaven. Blue is considered beneficial to the mind and body. It slows human metabolism and produces a calming effect. Blue is strongly associated with tranquility and calmness. In heraldry, blue is used to symbolize piety and sincerity. Blue is a masculine color; according to studies, it is highly accepted among males. Dark blue is associated with depth, expertise, and stability; it is a preferred color for corporate America. Light blue is associated with health, healing, tranquility, understanding, and softness. Dark blue represents knowledge, power, integrity, and seriousness.",
   "Banana": "A Banana is a fruit that grows in clusters on banana trees. There are about 100 different kinds of banana trees. Some banana trees grow edible fruit. There are several kinds of bananas in different colors. When most bananas are ripe, they turn yellow with brown patches. Unripe bananas are usually green, but it also depends what country they are grown in. Many bananas have a curved shape, but some bananas are straight. Bananas have a lot of potassium. Bananas are grown around the world. The countries that export (send to other places for sale) the most bananas include India, Brazil, China, Ecuador and the Philippines.",
   "Biel": "Biel (or Bienne) is an industrial town in Switzerland. It is in the part of Switzerland named Bern and near the city also named Bern. The town is known for many companies that make watches and machines. History. For many hundreds of years the town was run by another place named Basel. It tried to join with other cities in Switzerland. But it was not allowed to join the Swiss Confederation until 1815. Biel is home to a firm named Swatch which makes watches sold around the world. In 1998, Swatch announced that Biel would be the center of a new way of measuring time. Biel Mean Time was created as a way to advertise that Swatch was a modern firm with new ideas. Language. About 57% of the people in Biel speak German as their mother tongue. The remaining 43% speak French as their mother tongue. That is why the city has two names.",
   "Lithium": "Lithium (symbol Li) is the third chemical element in the periodic table. This means that it has 3 protons in its nucleus and 3 electrons around it. Lithium belongs to Group I. It is one of the alkali metals. Lithium is a silvery solid (when freshly cut). It is very soft. Thus it can be cut easily with a knife. It will react with water, giving off hydrogen to form an alkaline solution. Because of this, lithium must be stored in oil. Lithium is the lightest solid element in the periodic table. It is primarily used in heat transfer alloys, in batteries and serves as a component in some drugs known as mood stabilizers. Lithium is the lightest metal. It has a density that is only half that of water. It is very reactive. It does not occur freely in nature. History. Lithium (Greek \"lithos\", meaning \"stone\") was discovered by Johann Arfvedson in 1817. In 1818, Christian Gmelin observed that lithium salts give a bright red color in flame. W.T. Brande and Sir Humphrey Davy later used electrolysis on lithium oxide to isolate the element. It was apparently given the name \"lithium\" because it was discovered from a mineral, while other common alkali metals were first discovered from plant tissue. Lithuims boiling point is 356.97 degrees faraniheit Isotopes. There are 5 isotopes of Lithium having respectively 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 neutrons in the nucleus. The most common isotope in nature is 3Li7 which makes up 92.58 % of the total. The second isotope which is widely available is 3Li6 which makes up 7.42 % of the total. The other 3 isotopes exist in very small quantities. The atomic mass of Lithium is 6.939.",
   "Data compression": "Data compression is making data use less space on a data storage device. When we compress data, we make it smaller. Some reasons why data is compressed are: to make it download faster, to make it fit on floppy disks, and to make it easier to archive (keep). To make pictures and movies smaller, we often remove parts that the human eye cannot see. This is known as \"lossy\" compression and it is effective because of human limitations. There are many different ways to compress data. The most common way is known as \"zipping\" data. You can also \"unzip\" data to use it again. The output from \"unzipping\" a zip file are files identical to the original files, this is known as \"lossless\" compression.",
   "Compiler": "In computer science, a compiler is a program that takes \"source code\" and changes it to a target language (mostly machine code). For many programmers, using a compiler is easier than writing the machine code themselves because there are many different machine codes (it can take a long time to write for each of the machine codes).",
   "Insect": "Insects are a group of invertebrate animals and are part of the phylum Arthropoda. They are the biological class Insecta'\". Some people call insects \"bugs\", but this is not right; insects are insects, not \"bugs\". Only some insects are true bugs, which is a special group of insects. Insects are the biggest group of animals on earth, and there are more than 800,000 different kinds (or species) of them. There are often new species of insects being found, and scientists think there are millions of species people have not found yet. There are more insects than all other kinds of animals. Insects live all over the planet, but not many insects live in the oceans or in very cold places, such as Antarctica. The most kinds of insects live in tropical areas. The science of insects is called entomology, and people who study insects are called entomologists. Insect bodies. Insects have exoskeletons (skeletons on the outside). This does not mean they have bones on the outside of their bodies. Their skeletons are made out of thin, hard pieces or plates, like armour. All together, these pieces make a hard layer around the insect\u2019s body. The exoskeleton protects the insect. Just like our muscles connect to our bones to make us walk and stand up, the muscles of an insect connect to the exoskeleton to make it walk and move. The body of an insect has three main parts: a head, a thorax, and an abdomen. On the head are an insect\u2019s eyes, its antennae (they feel and smell things), and its mouth. On the thorax, insects have wings and legs. All insects have six legs (three pairs) and usually four wings (two pairs). The abdomen is the back part of the insect. Inside the abdomen is the stomach, the heart, and the excretory system where body wastes pass out of the insect. Bees also have a stinger at the back of the abdomen. How insects grow. Insects grow very differently than people. Most insects start as an egg that a female (mother) insect lays. These eggs are very small; many can not be seen without special help, such as a magnifying glass or a microscope. After the eggs hatch, there are two different things that can happen. Some insects have what is called incomplete metamorphosis. This means that a small insect, called a nymph comes out of the egg, and the nymph looks almost the same as the adult insect. As the nymph grows, it does not change the way it looks, but only how big it is. Grasshoppers grow in this way. Other insects have complete metamorphosis, which means that the small insect that comes out of the egg looks very different from the adult insect. Insects that have complete metamorphosis usually come out of the egg as a larva, which usually looks like a worm. The larva eats food and gets bigger until it turns into a pupa. Butterfly pupae (plural for pupa) are often inside cocoons. Inside the cocoon the insect changes the way it looks and often grows wings. When the cocoon opens, the adult insect comes out. Many insects have complete metamorphosis, for example beetles, butterflies and moths, and flies. Kinds of insects. Contrary to what some people believe, spiders, scorpions, and similar animals are not insects; they are arachnids. Arachnids are arthropods that have 4 pairs of legs. Centipedes are arthropods with many legs and are also not insects. Insects and people. People often think of insects as being either good or bad. \u201cGood\u201d insects are beneficial to people, meaning they do things that help people. \u201cBad\u201d insects are called pests. Pest insects can be harmful to people in different ways. Some are parasites, such as lice and bed bugs. Some of these parasite insects can spread diseases, such as mosquitoes spreading malaria. Other pest insects do not directly hurt people. Termites and some beetles eat wood and sometimes eat buildings, such as houses. Many insects eat agricultural products (plants meant for people to eat). Grasshoppers are one example of pest insects that eat plants in agriculture. Many people think all insects are bad, but this is not true. Many insects help people. Some kinds of insects, such as bees, make food (honey) that people can eat. The larvae of some moths make silk, which people use to make clothing. In some parts of the world, people actually eat insects. Eating insects for food is called entomophagy. Insects help people in other ways. Many bees and flies pollinate plants. This means the insects help the plants make seeds by moving pollen from one flower to another. Some good insects eat pest insects, such as lady beetles (or ladybirds or ladybugs) eating aphids. Many insects eat dead plants and animals. This is good because, if they did not eat all the dead things, there would be dead plants and animals everywhere. People often use poisons called insecticides to kill pest insects. Insecticides do not always work. Sometimes the pest insects become resistant to the insecticides, which means the insecticides can not hurt them anymore. Both the Colorado potato beetle and the diamondback moth are insects that are resistant to many insecticides. Insecticides do not only kill pest insects; sometimes many helpful insects are killed too. When helpful insects are killed, such as those that eat pest insects, the pest insects may come back in larger numbers than before because they are not being eaten by helpful insects anymore. (Simplified) Taxonomy. This taxonomy lists some of the better known groups of insects.",
   "Gross domestic product": "In economics, the gross domestic product (GDP) is how much a place produces in some amount of time. For nations, the GDP can be found by adding up its output inside the borders of that country. To know the GDP of a country, one would need to add up the consumer spending, investment spending, government spending and the value of the exports and subtract the value of the imports. This measure is often used to find out the health of a country in an economic way. In other words, a country with a high value of GDP can be called a large economy. This measure is different from gross national product (GNP) in that GNP = GDP + net income from assets abroad (net income receipts). While nominal GDP is the total amount of money spent on GDP, real GDP (like real in most economic meaning) tries to correct this number for inflation. For example, if the price level rises by 2% (everything costs 2% more), and the nominal GDP grows by 5%, the real GDP is still only 3%.",
   "Badminton": "Badminton is a sport for two or four people. In this way, either the game consists of one player against one player or a team of two players against another team of two players. Players use racquets to hit a shuttlecock over a net. The aim of the game is to hit the shuttlecock over the net in a way that the other player or pair cannot hit it back before it hits the floor. Also the aim is for the shuttlecock not to land outside the court. Every time this is done, the player or pair gets one point, if they were serving. If the other team was serving, the first team gets to serve. The first player or pair to reach 21 points wins a game. The winner of the match is the first to win 2 sets. In both singles and doubles, there is a change of service when the server loses a point. In doubles, the first team to serve has one player serve. All other times, both players on the team serve. History. Badminton was invented by British soldiers in Pune, India in the 19th century. As the city of Pune was formerly known as Poona, the game was also called Poona then.",
   "Chemical warfare": "If we use chemicals (like Agent Orange or glyphosate) to destroy plants, sometimes human beings may be affected by side-effects. But, we will not call it chemical warfare. Chemical warfare covers only direct attacks on human life. Use in antiquity. The first form of chemical warfare was in the form of poisoned arrows, and spear-tips, during the Stone age. These were dipped in poison (like that from snakes or scorpions. Sometimes poisonous plants were used. The Ancient Chinese used various forms of poisonous smokes, when they besieged a city. Ancient Greeks used a form of burning wood, pitch, and sulphur. Modern use. Chemical warfare was used for the first time in World War I. Chlorine, mustard gas, and phosgene gas were used in the war, to kill or hurt enemy soldiers. But, they were not used very much in World War II, apart by the Japanese army during the invasion of China. This was because, everybody was afraid that the other side would use weapons like theirs. Also, chemical weapons were not easy to use. The time taken to use them, slowed the advance of one's own troops. The raw materials for producing chemical weapons were not easy to get. This was because World War II was fought in areas which were not connected well by railroads. During the Iran-Iraq War, Iraq used chemical weapons, but not Iran. Many people believe that Iraq used chemical weapons against Kurdish people. According to international law, it is wrong to use chemical weapons. There are many rules that ban the production, import and use of chemical weapons. Of these the most important is the Chemical Weapons Convention(CWC). UN formed a working group in 1980 that works for making the number of chemical weapons in the world less. On April 4, 1984 the President of United States, Ronald Reagan called for an world-wide ban on chemical weapons. After this, negotiations between various countries started. The Chemical Weapons Convention was signed in 1993 and came into effect in 1997. Experts believe that 70,000 metric tons of chemical weapons are known to be present totally in this world. Out of this, 8000 metric tons have been destroyed in the past few years. By 2003, United States had destroyed 23% of its total chemical weapons. Other countries like India, South Korea and Russia are destroying chemical weapons under the CWC. Libya is also destroying its weapons in the last few years. It has been reported that many other countries like People's Republic of China, Cuba, Egypt, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, Sudan, Syria, Taiwan, Serbia and Montenegro have chemical weapons.",
   "Iran": "Iran or Persia is a country in South Asia part of the Greater Middle East region. It shares borders with Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Pakistan, Turkey, and Turkmenistan. Tehran is the capital and the biggest city. Iran is the 18th largest country in the world and has 70million people. History. Iran used to be called Persia for a long time by people outside of Iran. Iranians or Persians since the Sassanian era called their country \"Iran\". The name Iran comes from \"Aryan\" and is also mentioned in the ancient book of the Zoroastrians, which was called the Avesta. \"Iran\" means \"Land of Aryans\" Around 500 BC, present-day Iran was the center of the Persian Empire. Then, Alexander the Great took the country by fighting and the \"Achaemenid dynasty\" of Persia later ruled. After them the \"Sassanian dynasty\" (AD 224-651) took over. Other people took Persia by fighting like the Arabs (7th century), Turks (10th century) and Mongols (13th century). However, Iran has always maintained a distinct culture and continued to survive. The \"Safavid dynasty\" (1502-1736) made Islam the religion of Iran although Islam was always popular then. The latest kings of Iran where from \"Pahlavi dynasty\", and ruled from 1925 until 1979, when there was a revolution and Ayatollah Khomeini created an Islamic republic. In 1951 Dr. Mohammed Mossadegh was brought to power after being elected as prime minister by nearly all members of the Majlis (parliament) in Iran. His first act in office was to take control of the oil industry in Iran which had been controlled by Great Britain. Most of Britain's oil was pumped from Iran at the time. This move was seen as a danger to Great Britain's security and empire, so they tried to overthrow the government but failed. After this they convinced the United States through diplomacy that the government of Iran was a communist threat. The CIA worked in Iran to create riots which led to the removal of Prime Minister Mossadegh. The United States and Great Britain then made the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi leader of Iran again. He ruled in Iran for less than a year when he left Iran and the Iranian government was changed to an Islamic Republic. Soon afterwards, Iranian students, with the backing of the new government took over the U.S. Embassy and held most of the diplomats hostage for over a year. Relations between the two countries have not been good since. For example. The US has imposed various types of economic sanctions against Iran. The US claims the Iran supports terrorist groups against Israel, something that is completly not true. Iran does not recognize Israel as a state. Iran, along with most Arab countries believe that Israel does not have the right to occupy the land of Palestinians. Iran has long borders in common with Iraq. (The words \"Iran\" and \"Iraq\" are similar only in Latin alphabet. In Arabic and Persian, they are written different.) Iranians are ethnically not Arabs. Iran defended itself against Iraqi invasion in 1980, a war that lasted eight years. Many Arab and Western countries, including the United States provided weapons (including biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction) and technical support for Iraq's Saddam Hussein. Today, the West is trying hard to prevent Iran from mastering nuclear technology, even though Iran is a member of the NPT. They voice their concern claiming that Iran's intention is to develop nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reported numerous times that there is no evidence that Iran is developing nuclear weapons, however, it also says that it cannot say for sure that Iran is not doing so in secret. A CIA report on nuclear activity in Iran in December 2007 claimed that Iran's secret program to achieve nuclear weapons technology was stopped in 2003, and that since then, it was never restarted. It reports that Iran's ability to build a nuclear weapon will probably not happen soon.",

The Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable are examples of handheld consoles. Some video game consoles can also run general software, such as Linux.",
   "PlayStation": "The PlayStation is a video game console made by Sony. At the time it was competeing against the Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn. PlayStation games were released on CD-ROMs. The controllers that were originally released with the console had no analog joysticks on them, but these, along with a vibration feature, were added to later controllers. A slimmer version of the console called the PSOne was released in 2000. This was white, not grey, in colour.",
   "Election": "An election is a way people can choose their candidate or their preferences in a democracy or other form of government. Most democratic countries hold new elections for their national legislature every few years, but this differs from country to country. Some democracies elect other national officials (such as a president). In others, these are appointed. Democratic countries also hold local (or municipal) elections. Some democracies have regional, provincial or state elections too. There are different ways to organize an election in different countries. Voters might vote for an individual, or they might vote for a political party (party list). This is because different countries use different voting systems. Countries that are not democracies can also hold elections. This is usually done to let the people choose a local representative (like a mayor). Also many countries call themselves democracies, but behind the scenes have a more autocratic form of government.Elections are done between the main person and the opposition. Psephology is the study of elections.",
   "Medicine": "Medicine is the science that deals with diseases (illnesses) in humans, the best ways to prevent diseases, and the best ways to return to a healthy condition. People who practice \"medicine\" are most often called medical doctors / physicians (the words mean the same) or surgeons. For their work, doctors are assisted by nurses and many other types of health care professionals. The word medicine can also mean special food or a chemical that makes someone better when they are ill. A lot of medicines are liquid and can be bought in a small bottle. The doctor may tell the patient (person who is ill) how many spoonfuls to take each day. Most medicines cannot be bought unless the doctor has \"prescribed\" the medicine for the patient. The doctor writes a \"prescription\" which the patient takes to the chemist (or \"pharmacist\") who gives him the medicine. In the USA the chemist is called a druggist.",
   "Road": "A road is a piece of land which connects two or more places. Usually, a road has been made easy to travel on, for example by removing trees and stones so the ground is more level. Although many roads are made of gravel and dirt, some are made of concrete or brick. People have been making roads for a long time. Roman roads and the Incan courier roads are famous. But transport by river was usually easier and faster than transport by road. In the industrial revolution, the railway was invented. A railway is a special type of road, using rails. Roads are now usually made for wheeled vehicles, like cars, to travel on. Road building and care is usually paid for by taxes. Some roads have tolls, where people pay to use the road.",

If measured from top to bottom, below sea level, it is 10,200 meters high and would be the tallest mountain in the world. It is around 1,000,000 years old. Mauna Kea means 'white mountain' because in winter it often has snow at the summit.",
   "Mauna Loa": "Mauna Loa is an active volcano in the Hawaiian Islands of the United States. Measured from sea level Mauna Loa is 4,169 meters high. It is also one of the largest volcanoes measuring 60 miles long and 30 miles wide. It is about 40,000 cubic meters in volume and over 4 kilometers above sea level. Measured from its base on the ocean floor it reaches above 8 kilometers making it one of the tallest mountain on Earth, but not the highest. That distinction is reserved for Mount Everest.",

It is called foolscap because, in the 18th century, folio-sized paper had the watermark of a fool's cap on it. In the UK, foolscap paper is 13\" X 8\" (c 330mm X 203mm), but paper of the size is now very rarely used, being superseded by A4 (297 x 210). Older people may call A4 \"foolscap\". Nevertheless, ring binders, lever arch files, suspended files, and other filing related things still use the size.",
   "Phrase": "A phrase is a small group of words that adds meaning to a word. A phrase is not a sentence because it is not a complete idea with a subject and a predicate. In English there are five different kinds of phrases, one for each of the main parts of speech. In a phrase, the main word, or the word that is what the phrase is about, is called the \"head.\" In these examples, it is printed in cyan. The words which make up the rest of the phrase and do the work of changing, or \"modifying\" the head, are printed in \"green\". In a noun phrase, one or more words work together to give more information about a noun. In an adjective phrase, one or more words work together to give more information about an adjective. In a verb phrase, one or more words work together to give more meaning to a verb. In English, the verb phrase is very complex, but a good description of its many forms can be found. In an adverb phrase, one or more words work together to give more information about an adverb. In a prepositional phrase, one or more words work together to give information about time, location, or possession, or condition. The preposition always appears at the front of the phrase.",
   "Possess": "To possess is to have or to own. \"I possess all my teeth,\" means I still have all I was born with. \"The woman possesses five cars,\" means she owns five cars. A \"possession\" is something you own. \"My only \"possessions\" are my cat and my brains.\" In some beliefs, to be possessed is to be under the control of devils, demons, or evil spirits. These people may do evil or terrible things because of their \"possession.\" Sometimes this \"possession\" was because the person had epilepsy. As the reasons for epilepsy were not known people decided it was caused by evil.",
   "Sunday": "Sunday is one of the seven days of the week. It is part of the weekend, along with Saturday. Sunday is the day of worship for most Christians (for example, Easter is celebrated on Sunday).

   "Para rubber tree": "A Para rubber tree (or simply, rubber tree) is the tree which naturally produces rubber. It is native from tropical areas from South America, in the Amazon (Brazil), but was spread by English farmers to the Far East. Para Rubber trees belong to the Euphorbiaceae family. In the wild they may reach heights of 100 to 125 ft (30-38 m) with large cylindrical trunks with or without buttresses. Crop trees reach a width of about 20 in. (50 cm), usually with a short bole, and with a sloped taper. When trees reach 5-6 years old, they are harvested. Their trunks are cut just deep enough to tap the vessels without harming the tree's growth, and the sap is collected in small buckets. This process is known as rubber tapping. Older trees produce more latex, but they stop producing it after 26-30 years.",
   "Safety curtain": "A safety curtain is a curtain in theatre at the front of the stage. It is made of material that will not burn. The safety curtain may be lowered during the intermission and after the performance. A safety curtain is there in case there is a fire on stage. It will stop the fire from spreading to the auditorium where the audience sits.",
   "Safety lamp": "A safety lamp is a miner's lamp with a covered flame that used to be used in coal mines. How it works. Coal mines are dangerous because of flammable gases like methane that can accumulate. A lamp with a naked (exposed) flame might ignite these flammable gases, causing an explosion, which might kill people. The safety lamp prevents the hot flame of the lamp touching the flammable gasses, reducing the chance of an explosion.",

   "Sex": "Humans. A person's sex is either male or female. For example: John's sex is male. Mary's sex is female. This difference is sometimes called gender. Not all living things have a sex. There are not male or female germs or yeast. Only animals that make babies using an \"ovum\" and \"sperm\" have a sex. In humans, the sex of a person depends on what sex chromosomes that person has in his or her cells. All of a woman's ova already contain one X chromosome. A man's sperm contains either an X or a Y chromosome. When a sperm and ova combine to form a baby, the baby may get either of these chromosomes from its father. If the baby gets two X chromosomes, it will usually develop into a girl. If the baby gets one X and one Y, it will usually develop into a boy. There are exceptions to this rule, though. For example, sometimes a baby with XY chromosomes will not respond to the Y and develop as a girl. Before babies are born, they grow either male sex parts or female sex parts. Very few people grow none or both, but some do. It's hard for these people because they often feel sad about people seeing them as being different. These people can be called intersexed people or hermaphrodites. Sometimes, people feel that they are the other sex. For example, they have male sex parts but they feel like a woman. If they think really carefully about this, and think they should be the other sex, they can say they are a woman, and even get their sex parts changed to female sex parts. These people are called transgendered people.",

There are many types of blade, and a variety of uses, probably the most common of which is weeding. Along with the spade and fork, the hoe is considered a basic, essential hand farming implement.",
   "Oral history": "Oral history is history that is told rather than written down. It is given through talking rather than reading a book. It is usually passed from generation to generation in order to explain events that have occurred. Though today oral history is not as popular as written history, it is still used in many places as a way of transferring knowledge about the past.",
   "Generation": "A generation is often to mean the average amount of time between the birth of parents and the birth of their children. It is also used to mean all the people on one level of a family tree. For example, your brothers, sisters and cousins are in the same generation as you.",

Rain, snow, sleet, dew, frost, hail, and drizzle are all forms of precipitation. It is any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapor that is left on the ground. It can be measured using a rain gauge. Precipitation is also a chemical reaction, when two or more solutions are mixed together and the product is insoluble a precipitate is formed. This is a precipitation reaction.",
   "Relative humidity": "Relative humidity is the ratio between the partial pressure of water vapour in the air and the saturation vapour pressure of water vapour at that temperature. This is expressed as a percentage.",
   "Vitamin C": "Vitamin C is a vitamin. It is also called ascorbic acid. It dissolves in water. It is found in fresh fruits and berries and green vegetables. Vitamin C helps wounds heal. Lack of vitamin C can cause a sickness called scurvy, where the gums in the mouth bleed easily and wounds won't heal. Lack of Vitamin C used to be a big health problem on long ocean trips by ship where supplies of fresh fruit were quickly used up. Many people would die from scurvy on such trips. Most animals can make their own vitamin C, but some animals cannot. Some of those which cannot make their own vitamin C, are guinea pigs, humans, and apes. Vitamin C was first found in 1928, and in 1932 it was proved to stop the sickness called scurvy. Through history the need for people to eat fresh plant food to help them get through long sieges or long sea trips was known by some wise people but was often forgotten. The first attempt to prove this idea was by a ship's doctor in the British Royal Navy called James Lind, who at sea in May 1747 gave some crew members lemon juice as well as their normal ships food, while others continued on normal food alone. The results showed that lemons prevented the disease. Lind wrote up his work and published it in 1753. Lind's work was slow to be noticed. It was 1795 before the British navy adopted lemon or lime juice as food for sailors. As well as lemons, limes and oranges; sauerkraut, salted cabbage, malt, and soup were tried with different effects. James Cook relied on sauerkraut to prevent the disease on his long voyages of exploration. It was believed that only humans got scurvy but in 1907, Alex Holst and Theodore Frohlich, two Norwegian chemists found that guinea pigs could also get it if not given fresh food. In 1928 the Arctic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson proved that Eskimo (Inuit) people are able to avoid scurvy with almost no plant food in their diet by eating raw meat. In 1912 the Polish American scientist Casimir Funk had the idea of the name of vitamins for the things present in food in small amounts which are essential to health. He named the unknown thing which prevented scurvy, Vitamin C. From 1928 to 1933, the Hungarian research team of Joseph L Svirbely and Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, and separately the American Charles Glen King, first took out vitamin C from food and showed it to be an acid they called ascorbic acid. In 1933/1934, the British chemists Sir Walter Norman Haworth and Sir Edmund Hirst, and separately the Polish Tadeus Reichstein, had success in making the vitamin. It was the first to be made by man. It then became possible to make lots of vitamin C cheaply in factories. Haworth was awarded the 1937 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for this work. In 1959 the American J.J. Burns showed that the reason why some animals get scurvy is because their liver cannot make just one chemical enzyme that all other animals have. Plant sources. Citrus fruits such as lime, lemon, orange, andgrapefruit) are good sources of vitamin C. Other foods that are good sources of vitamin C include papaya, broccoli, brussels sprouts, blackcurrants, strawberries, cauliflower, spinach, cantaloupe, green peppers, and kiwifruit. The following table is to give an idea of how much vitamin c there is in different plant foods. Each individual fruit will vary. The amount of vitamin C in foods of plant origin depends on the kind of plant, the kind of soil where it grew, how much rain and sun it got, the length of time since it was picked, and how it was stored since then. Animal sources. Most species of animals synthesise their own vitamin C. It is therefore not a vitamin for them. Synthesis in achieved through a sequence of enzyme driven steps, which convert glucose to ascorbic acid. It is carried out either in the kidneys, in reptiles and birds, or the liver, in mammals and perching birds. The loss of an enzyme concerned with ascorbic acid synthesis has occurred quite frequently in evolution and has affected most fish, many birds; some bats, guinea pigs and most but not all primates, including Man. The mutations have not been lethal because ascorbic acid is so prevalent in the surrounding food sources. It was only realised in the 1920s that some cuts of meat and fish are also a source of vitamin C for humans. The muscle and fat which make up the modern western diet are however poor sources. As with fruit and vegetables cooking destroys the vitamin C content. Artificial chemical synthesis. Vitamin C is produced from glucose by two main routes. The Reichstein process developed in the 1930s uses a single pre-fermentation followed by a purely chemical route. The more modern Two-Step fermentation process was originally developed in China in the 1960s, uses additional fermentation to replace part of the later chemical stages. Both processes yield approximately 60% vitamin C from the glucose feed. In 1934, the Swiss pharmaceutical company Hoffmann-La Roche was the first to mass produce synthetic vitamin C, under the brand name of Redoxon. Main producers today are BASF/ Takeda, Roche, Merck and the China Pharmaceutical Group Ltd of the People's Republic of China. Vitamin C deficiency. Lack of ascorbic acid in the daily diet leads to a disease Daily requirement. A healthy person on a balanced western diet should be able to get all the vitamin C needed to prevent the symptoms of scurvy from their daily diet. People who smoke, those under stress and women in pregnancy have a slightly higher requirement. High doses (thousands of mg) may result in diarrhoea, which is harmless if the dose is reduced immediately. Some researchers (Cathcart) claim the onset of diarrhoea to be an indication of where the body\u2019s true vitamin C requirement lies. The small size of the ascorbic acid molecule means the kidneys cannot retain it in the body. Quite a low level in the blood serum will cause traces to be present in the urine. All vitamin C synthesising mammals have traces in the urine at all times. In April 1998 \"Nature\" reported alleged carcinogenic and teratogenic effects of excessive doses of vitamin C. This was given great prominence in the world's media. The effects were noted in test tube experiments and on only two of the 20 markers of free radical damage to DNA. They have not been supported by further evidence from living organisms. Almost all mammals manufacture their own vitamin C in amounts equivalent to human doses of thousands of milligrams per day. Large amounts of the vitamin are used in orthomolecular medicine and no harmful effects have been observed even in doses of 10,000 mg per day or more. Therapeutic uses. Vitamin C is needed in the diet to prevent scurvy. It also has a reputation for being useful in the treatment of colds and flu. The evidence to support this idea, however, is ambiguous and the effect may depend on the dose size and dosing regime. The Vitamin C foundation () recommends 8 grams of vitamin C every half hour in order to show an effect on the symptoms of a cold infection that is in progress. Vitamin C advocacy. Fred R. Klenner, a doctor in Reidsville, North Carolina reported in 1949 that poliomyelitis yielded to vitamin C. Nobel Prize winning chemist Linus Pauling began actively promoting vitamin C in the 1960s as a means to greatly improve human health and resistance to disease. A minority of medical and scientific opinion continues to see vitamin C as being a low cost and safe way to treat infectious disease and to deal with a wide range of poisons. A megadose of one-half gram per pound of body weight (one gram per kilogram of body weight) per day of sodium ascorbate salt has been found of theraputic use in both human and veterinary treatments. A meta-study into the published research on effectiveness of ascorbic acid in the treatment of infectious disease and toxins was conducted, in 2002, by Thomas Levy, Medical Director of the Colorado Integrative Medical Center in Denver. It claimed that overwhelming scientific evidence exists for its therapeutic role. Some vitamin C advocates say that vitamin C cannot be used therapeutically because it cannot now be patented. Pharmaceutical companies are unwilling to research or promote something that will make them little money.",

A rechargeable battery can be \"recharged\" by passing electric current backwards through it; it can then be used again to produce more electricity. Batteries come in many shapes and sizes, from very small ones used in watches and cameras, to those used in cars or even larger ones.",
   "Das Lied der Deutschen": "Das Lied der Deutschen (\"The Song of the German people\"), also known as Das Deutschlandlied, (\"The Song of Germany\"), is a song written by Joseph Haydn and Hoffmann von Fallersleben. Part of this song is the national anthem of Germany (German National Anthem). A line from this song, \"Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit\" (\"Unity and justice and freedom\") is the motto of Germany. History. The music was written by Haydn in 1797 as the anthem of Austria. It was called \"Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser\" (\"God protect our Emperor Franz\"). The words which are used today were written by the poet August Heinrich Hoffman von Fallersleben in 1841. Today, the first line \"Germany, Germany above all\" sounds too strong for some people, and is often misunderstood. Fallersleben wanted a united Germany when he wrote it. At that time, Germany was not one country, but many small countries. So \"Germany above all\" meant that the most important thing to do was to have a unified Germany. Also, the poet was in Heligoland, where people spoke German but were ruled by the British. Fallersleben's music was very popular in Germany during the second part of the 19th century. This song was not a national anthem then, but a song for people who loved the idea of a strong and united Germany. In 1918, it replaced the anthem of the German Empire \"Heil Dir im Siegerkranz\" (\"Praise to the war-winner\"), when the Emperor Wilhelm II lost power at the end of the First World War. In 1921, a \"fourth stanza\", a new part or verse, was written by poet Albert Matthai with words about the difficult life in Germany at that time. It was not sung very often. During the time of Hitler, only the first part of the song was used. This was often followed by a Nazi party song. This part of the song was difficult for some people who were not Germans because it has words describing Germany as a country that included land that was in other countries. After the Second World War, Germany was divided into two countries. In 1949, the new Western Germany tried to get a new song for the national anthem. Another song was chosen, written by poet Rudolf Alexander Schr\u00f6der. It was not very popular. Finally, the third part of the Fallersleben song was made into the national anthem. In the other part of Germany, the Eastern Germany, the words of poet Johannes R. Becher (\"Auferstanden aus Ruinen\" - \"Re-built from the Ruins\") were used with a song written by Hanns Eisler. It was not very popular, and from the 1970s the words were not sung, because of the line \"Germany, [our] unified fatherland\". After East and West Germany united again in 1990, the Fallersleben song again became the national anthem of Germany but only the third part is used. Today, the first part of the song is popular with nationalist extremists. Third stanza - the German National Anthem. __NOTOC__"
